      "message": "Governance models misattributed to The Register (January 2026 article)",
      "details": "The article states 'As documented by The Register, three concrete governance proposals emerged' and then describes a centralized model, consortium model, and independent model. Verification of the cited Register article (theregister.com/2026/01/23/mysql_post_oracle/) shows it describes three different options: remaining under Oracle, a hard fork (like MariaDB), and a tracking fork (like Percona's Server for MySQL). The foundation/consortium framing appears to originate from the InfoWorld or heise source, not The Register. The attribution must be corrected."

      "message": "Oracle spokesperson incorrectly identified as 'Oracle SVP Jason Wilcox'",
      "details": "The article states 'Oracle SVP Jason Wilcox outlined the strategy' at a pre-FOSDEM event. Verification of the cited Register article (theregister.com/2026/02/16/oracle_new_era_mysql/) identifies Frederic Descamps, Oracle's MySQL Community Manager, as the spokesperson for the new era announcement. 'Jason Wilcox' does not appear in the cited source. The article must either correct the name/title or provide a specific source for Wilcox's involvement."

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured and well-written Analysis piece. The topic is timely and genuinely significant — MySQL governance is a developing story with real industry implications. The writing is neutral and professional throughout, with no editorializing or AI self-references.",
    "source_verification": "Two Register articles are reputable and accessible. InfoWorld (IDG Communications) and heise.de (Germany's leading tech outlet) are both reputable despite not being on the allowlist — they should be added. Key statistics (contributor count drop from 135 to 75, commit drop from 22,360 to 4,730) were confirmed against the InfoWorld source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Two attribution errors require correction. (1) The three specific governance model names (centralized, consortium, independent) are credited to The Register, but the Register article describes fork-based options, not foundation models. The foundation framing likely originates from InfoWorld or heise.de and must be re-attributed. (2) 'Oracle SVP Jason Wilcox' is not found in the Oracle February 2026 announcement article — that article credits Frederic Descamps (MySQL Community Manager). The submission must name the correct spokesperson and provide the correct title or remove the specific name.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and appropriately skeptical — the article correctly frames Oracle's commitments as unverified while acknowledging the community's leverage. No loaded language detected.",
    "originality": "No prior MySQL or database governance coverage in recent articles. Clear editorial value.",
    "concerns": [
      "Governance models misattributed to The Register instead of InfoWorld or heise.de",
      "Oracle spokesperson named as 'Jason Wilcox' but The Register credits Frederic Descamps (MySQL Community Manager)"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Re-attribute the three governance model descriptions (centralized, consortium, independent) to the correct source (InfoWorld or heise.de)",
      "Correct the Oracle spokesperson reference: the February 2026 Register article identifies Frederic Descamps, not Jason Wilcox. Either correct the name/title or cite a specific source for Wilcox.",
      "Add infoworld.com and heise.de to config/source_allowlist.txt — both are established, reputable outlets"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong article with a compelling and timely topic. Two factual attribution errors identified during source verification prevent approval. Both are correctable: fix the governance model attribution and correct the Oracle spokesperson name. The article is otherwise publication-ready."

    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nFor the first time since Oracle acquired MySQL in 2009, the database's own community has formally demanded the company relinquish control. A coalition of nearly 200 database professionals—including engineers from Percona, MariaDB, PlanetScale, Zoho, DigitalOcean, and Pinterest—has signed an open letter warning that MySQL faces stagnation, irrelevance, and eventual fragmentation unless governance is overhauled by the end of Q1 2026.\n\nOracle, stung by the public pressure, announced a ...",
