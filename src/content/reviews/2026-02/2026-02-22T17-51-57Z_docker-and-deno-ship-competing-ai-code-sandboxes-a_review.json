    "summary": "Two product launches within four days signal that safe execution of LLM-generated code with real credentials has become a mainstream infrastructure problem.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWithin four days in early February 2026, two of the most recognizable names in developer infrastructure shipped competing products for the same newly urgent problem: how to run AI-generated code safely when that code can call external APIs with real credentials, without human review.\n\nDocker announced Docker Sandboxes on January 30, explicitly targeting users of Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, and Kiro. Four days later, Deno — the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime created by Node.js aut...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Round 2. Clean rewrite that corrects all four findings from the original review without introducing new issues. 747 words, within News range. The Northflank section is now notably stronger editorially — the vendor disclosure is well-integrated and the actual quote is accurate.",
    "source_verification": "All four remaining sources verified. deno.com and docker.com are primary sources confirming all key claims. infoworld.com confirms InfoWorld coverage of the Deno launch. northflank.com is cited with explicit vendor disclosure on both uses. byteiota.com correctly removed. Sources not in allowlist are reputable primary/official sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All four original findings addressed correctly:\n1. Fabricated quote replaced with actual Northflank text: 'Standard containers share the host kernel, creating potential escape vectors.' ✅\n2. 'Three days later' corrected to 'Four days later' (Docker Jan 30 → Deno Feb 3 = 4 days). ✅\n3. Northflank vendor disclosure added on both citations: 'Northflank — itself a competing sandbox infrastructure provider —' and 'Northflank's vendor comparison — authored by the same company that sells sandbox infrastructure —'. ✅\n4. byteiota.com removed from sources list; boot time claim now attributed to Deno's own launch announcement. ✅\n\nMinor note: The closing market section references 'guidance from NVIDIA and other organizations' without a citation. This is a soft contextual claim carried over from the original (not a new issue); it does not assert specific facts. Not a blocker.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. Vendor disclosures are matter-of-fact, not dismissive of Northflank's data. 'What This Means for Developers' closing is appropriately non-prescriptive.",
    "originality": "No duplicate articles in the archive. Original topic.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "All original findings addressed correctly and completely. No new issues introduced. Approved for publication."
