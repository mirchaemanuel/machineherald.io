Running that code safely requires a purpose-built **code execution sandbox for AI agents:** infrastructure that isolates execution, scales elastically, and integrates directly with AI agent workflows.\\n\\nThe best code sandbox for AI agents depends on your requirements:\\n\\n- [**Northflank**](https://northflank.com/) is the best choice for teams that need production-grade microVM isolation, unlimited session duration, bring-your-own-cloud deployment, and a complete platform beyond just sandboxes. Northflank processes over 2 million isolated workloads monthly using Kata Containers and gVisor.\\n- **E2B** excels at AI-first SDK design with Firecracker microVMs, but limits sessions to 24 hours and requires you to manage scaling at higher volumes.\\n- **Modal** offers strong Python-centric workflows with gVisor isolation and massive autoscaling, but lacks BYOC options and on-prem deployment.\\n- **Daytona** delivers the fastest cold starts (sub-90ms) but uses Docker containers by default, weaker isolation than microVMs.\\n\\nFor teams evaluating the **best sandbox for AI code execution**, this guide compares isolation strength, session limits, pricing, and platform completeness across the top providers.\\n\\n&lt;/InfoBox&gt;\\n\\n## Why AI Agents need a dedicated code execution sandbox\\n\\nCursor alone generates nearly a billion lines of accepted code each day. AI coding assistants, autonomous agents, and LLM-powered applications are producing unprecedented volumes of code that needs a secure AI code sandbox to execute safely.\\n\\nRunning AI-generated code directly on your application servers, without a proper code execution sandbox**,** creates serious risks: it can expose secrets, overwhelm resources, escape container boundaries, or execute malicious operations, whether through bugs, hallucinations, or prompt injection attacks.\\n\\nPurpose-built AI sandboxes solve three problems simultaneously:\\n\\n**Security isolation:** Containers or microVMs cut the blast radius of malicious or buggy code. A compromised sandbox can&#39;t access your production databases or leak API keys.\\n\\n**Ephemeral scale:** Thousands of agent sessions can spin up and tear down in seconds without leaving idle infrastructure running up your bill.\\n\\n**Observability and guardrails:** Good sandbox platforms expose granular logs, metrics, and network controls so you can monitor and constrain what AI-generated code does.\\n\\n## What to look for in the best AI code execution sandbox\\n\\nWhen evaluating sandbox providers for AI agent workloads, focus on these criteria:\\n\\n1. **Isolation technology:** Does the AI sandbox platform use standard containers (shared kernel, weaker isolation), gVisor (user-space kernel interception), or microVMs like Firecracker and Kata Containers (dedicated kernel per workload)? For truly untrusted code, microVM isolation is essential.\\n2. **Startup latency:** How fast can sandboxes spin up? Sub-second cold starts keep your agents responsive. Some platforms offer snapshot-based resume for even faster warm starts.\\n3. **Session duration:** Can AI code execution sandboxes run for minutes, hours, or indefinitely? Many platforms impose strict time limits that break long-running agent workflows.\\n4. **Language and runtime flexibility:** Are you locked to Python and JavaScript, or can you run any containerized workload? Can you bring custom images or must you use SDK-defined environments?\\n5. **Infrastructure flexibility:** Can you deploy in your own cloud (BYOC), on-premises, or only on the provider&#39;s managed infrastructure? For regulated industries or data-sensitive applications, this matters.\\n6. **Networking controls:** Can you define egress policies, set up tunnels for database connections, or lock down outbound access entirely?\\n7. **Platform completeness:** Do you need just sandboxes, or will your AI application also require databases, backend APIs, GPU inference, and CI/CD? Starting with a complete platform avoids painful migrations.\\n\\n## The best code execution sandboxes for AI Agents, compared\\n\\n| Platform | Isolation | Cold start | Max session | BYOC | Languages | Best for |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Northflank** | MicroVM (Kata/CLH) + gVisor | Seconds, depending on whether the container image is pulled or not | Unlimited | Yes | Any OCI image | Complete AI infrastructure |\\n| **E2B** | MicroVM (Firecracker) | ~150ms | 24 hours | Experimental | Any Linux runtime | AI agent SDKs |\\n| **Modal** | gVisor containers | Sub-second | Configurable | No | Python-first | ML/data workloads |\\n| **Daytona** | Docker (Kata optional) | ~90ms | Stateful | No | Docker images | Fast agent iterations |\\n| **Together** | MicroVM | 500ms (resume) | Configurable | No | Dev containers | Together AI users |\\n| **Vercel Sandbox** | MicroVM (Firecracker) | Sub-second | 45 min–5 hr | No | Node.js, Python | Vercel ecosystem |\\n\\n## 1.

Standard containers share the host kernel, creating potential escape vectors. gVisor sits in between, intercepting syscalls in user space. For truly untrusted AI-generated code, microVM isolation is recommended.\\n\\n### How do sandbox session limits affect AI agent workflows?\\n\\nMany AI agents need to maintain state across extended user interactions, hours, days, or even weeks. Session limits of 45 minutes (Vercel) or 24 hours (E2B) force you to implement complex state serialization and restoration. Platforms with unlimited session duration like Northflank avoid this architectural complexity.\\n\\n### Can I run GPU workloads in AI sandboxes?\\n\\nSome platforms support GPU-accelerated sandboxes for AI inference. Northflank offers NVIDIA H100, A100, and other GPUs with all-inclusive pricing. Modal also supports GPUs but charges separately for GPU, CPU, and RAM. Check whether your sandbox provider supports the specific GPU types your workloads require.\\n\\n### What&#39;s the difference between BYOC and self-hosting?\\n\\nBYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) means the platform runs its control plane but provisions resources in your cloud account, you get the operational benefits of a managed platform while keeping data in your VPC. Self-hosting means you run everything yourself, including the control plane. Northflank offers true BYOC; E2B&#39;s self-hosting is still experimental.\\n\\n### How do I choose between an AI code sandbox platform and DIY with Kubernetes?\\n\\nBuilding sandbox infrastructure with Kubernetes, gVisor, or Firecracker is possible but requires significant engineering investment, typically months of work, plus ongoing operational burden. For most teams, a purpose-built platform provides better security, faster time-to-market, and lower total cost of ownership than rolling your own.\\n\\n### Which sandbox platform has the best pricing for high-volume workloads?\\n\\nPricing varies significantly based on workload patterns. For CPU-intensive workloads, Northflank&#39;s pricing ($0.01667/vCPU-hour) is approximately 65% cheaper than Modal ($0.047/vCPU-hour). For GPU workloads, Northflank&#39;s all-inclusive pricing ($2.74/hour for H100) is approximately 62% cheaper than Modal&#39;s separate billing for GPU, CPU, and RAM.\",\"header\":{\"url\":\"https://assets.northflank.com/best_code_execution_sandbox_for_ai_agents_4ae1c3572a.png\"},\"tags\":[{\"title\":\"AI\",\"slug\":\"ai\"}],\"html_link_tags\":null,\"show_contents\":false},\"renderedBlogPost\":\"&lt;div type=&quot;note&quot; class=&quot;sc-aXZVg sc-jnOGJG  eWlgOP BodyStyle&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sc-aXZVg dcNwtB&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#-tldr&quot; class=&quot;sc-aXZVg kHPnMb&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sc-gEvEer cFMfEA&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; class=&quot;StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M8.465 11.293c1.133-1.133 3.109-1.133 4.242 0l.707.707 1.414-1.414-.707-.707c-.943-.944-2.199-1.465-3.535-1.465s-2.592.521-3.535 1.465L4.929 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0 7.071 4.983 4.983 0 0 0 3.535 1.462A4.982 4.982 0 0 0 12 19.071l.707-.707-1.414-1.414-.707.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1-4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0-4.243l2.122-2.121z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;m12 4.929-.707.707 1.414 1.414.707-.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1 4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0 4.243l-2.122 2.121c-1.133 1.133-3.109 1.133-4.242 0L10.586 12l-1.414 1.414.707.707c.943.944 2.199 1.465 3.535 1.465s2.592-.521 3.535-1.465L19.071 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0-7.071 5.006 5.006 0 0 0-7.071 0z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;-tldr&quot;&gt;📌 TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI agents are generating billions of lines of code daily.

A compromised sandbox can&amp;#x27;t access your production databases or leak API keys.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephemeral scale:&lt;/strong&gt; Thousands of agent sessions can spin up and tear down in seconds without leaving idle infrastructure running up your bill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observability and guardrails:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sandbox platforms expose granular logs, metrics, and network controls so you can monitor and constrain what AI-generated code does.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;div class=&quot;sc-aXZVg dcNwtB&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-to-look-for-in-the-best-ai-code-execution-sandbox&quot; class=&quot;sc-aXZVg kHPnMb&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sc-gEvEer cFMfEA&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; class=&quot;StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M8.465 11.293c1.133-1.133 3.109-1.133 4.242 0l.707.707 1.414-1.414-.707-.707c-.943-.944-2.199-1.465-3.535-1.465s-2.592.521-3.535 1.465L4.929 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0 7.071 4.983 4.983 0 0 0 3.535 1.462A4.982 4.982 0 0 0 12 19.071l.707-.707-1.414-1.414-.707.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1-4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0-4.243l2.122-2.121z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;m12 4.929-.707.707 1.414 1.414.707-.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1 4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0 4.243l-2.122 2.121c-1.133 1.133-3.109 1.133-4.242 0L10.586 12l-1.414 1.414.707.707c.943.944 2.199 1.465 3.535 1.465s2.592-.521 3.535-1.465L19.071 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0-7.071 5.006 5.006 0 0 0-7.071 0z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-look-for-in-the-best-ai-code-execution-sandbox&quot;&gt;What to look for in the best AI code execution sandbox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;When evaluating sandbox providers for AI agent workloads, focus on these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Does the AI sandbox platform use standard containers (shared kernel, weaker isolation), gVisor (user-space kernel interception), or microVMs like Firecracker and Kata Containers (dedicated kernel per workload)? For truly untrusted code, microVM isolation is essential.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup latency:&lt;/strong&gt; How fast can sandboxes spin up? Sub-second cold starts keep your agents responsive. Some platforms offer snapshot-based resume for even faster warm starts.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session duration:&lt;/strong&gt; Can AI code execution sandboxes run for minutes, hours, or indefinitely? Many platforms impose strict time limits that break long-running agent workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language and runtime flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you locked to Python and JavaScript, or can you run any containerized workload? Can you bring custom images or must you use SDK-defined environments?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you deploy in your own cloud (BYOC), on-premises, or only on the provider&amp;#x27;s managed infrastructure? For regulated industries or data-sensitive applications, this matters.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you define egress policies, set up tunnels for database connections, or lock down outbound access entirely?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform completeness:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you need just sandboxes, or will your AI application also require databases, backend APIs, GPU inference, and CI/CD? Starting with a complete platform avoids painful migrations.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n&lt;div class=&quot;sc-aXZVg dcNwtB&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-best-code-execution-sandboxes-for-ai-agents-compared&quot; class=&quot;sc-aXZVg kHPnMb&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sc-gEvEer cFMfEA&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; class=&quot;StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M8.465 11.293c1.133-1.133 3.109-1.133 4.242 0l.707.707 1.414-1.414-.707-.707c-.943-.944-2.199-1.465-3.535-1.465s-2.592.521-3.535 1.465L4.929 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0 7.071 4.983 4.983 0 0 0 3.535 1.462A4.982 4.982 0 0 0 12 19.071l.707-.707-1.414-1.414-.707.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1-4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0-4.243l2.122-2.121z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;m12 4.929-.707.707 1.414 1.414.707-.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1 4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0 4.243l-2.122 2.121c-1.133 1.133-3.109 1.133-4.242 0L10.586 12l-1.414 1.414.707.707c.943.944 2.199 1.465 3.535 1.465s2.592-.521 3.535-1.465L19.071 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0-7.071 5.006 5.006 0 0 0-7.071 0z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best-code-execution-sandboxes-for-ai-agents-compared&quot;&gt;The best code execution sandboxes for AI Agents, compared&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;div class=&quot;tableWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Platform&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Isolation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cold start&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Max session&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;BYOC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Languages&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Best for&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northflank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MicroVM (Kata/CLH) + gVisor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Seconds, depending on whether the container image is pulled or not&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unlimited&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Any OCI image&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Complete AI infrastructure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E2B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MicroVM (Firecracker)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~150ms&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;24 hours&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Experimental&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Any Linux runtime&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AI agent SDKs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;gVisor containers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sub-second&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Configurable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Python-first&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ML/data workloads&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daytona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Docker (Kata optional)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~90ms&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stateful&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Docker images&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fast agent iterations&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MicroVM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;500ms (resume)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Configurable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dev containers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Together AI users&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vercel Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MicroVM (Firecracker)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sub-second&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;45 min–5 hr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Node.js, Python&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vercel ecosystem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;div class=&quot;sc-aXZVg dcNwtB&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-northflank-best-overall-code-execution-sandbox-platform-for-ai-agents-and-generally-ai-infrastructure&quot; class=&quot;sc-aXZVg kHPnMb&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sc-gEvEer cFMfEA&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; class=&quot;StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M8.465 11.293c1.133-1.133 3.109-1.133 4.242 0l.707.707 1.414-1.414-.707-.707c-.943-.944-2.199-1.465-3.535-1.465s-2.592.521-3.535 1.465L4.929 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0 7.071 4.983 4.983 0 0 0 3.535 1.462A4.982 4.982 0 0 0 12 19.071l.707-.707-1.414-1.414-.707.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1-4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0-4.243l2.122-2.121z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;m12 4.929-.707.707 1.414 1.414.707-.707a3.007 3.007 0 0 1 4.243 0 3.005 3.005 0 0 1 0 4.243l-2.122 2.121c-1.133 1.133-3.109 1.133-4.242 0L10.586 12l-1.414 1.414.707.707c.943.944 2.199 1.465 3.535 1.465s2.592-.521 3.535-1.465L19.071 12a5.008 5.008 0 0 0 0-7.071 5.006 5.006 0 0 0-7.071 0z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-northflank-best-overall-code-execution-sandbox-platform-for-ai-agents-and-generally-ai-infrastructure&quot;&gt;1.

Running that code safely requires a purpose-built <strong>code execution sandbox for AI agents:</strong> infrastructure that isolates execution, scales elastically, and integrates directly with AI agent workflows.</p><p>The best code sandbox for AI agents depends on your requirements:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://northflank.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Northflank</strong></a> is the best choice for teams that need production-grade microVM isolation, unlimited session duration, bring-your-own-cloud deployment, and a complete platform beyond just sandboxes. Northflank processes over 2 million isolated workloads monthly using Kata Containers and gVisor.</li>
<li><strong>E2B</strong> excels at AI-first SDK design with Firecracker microVMs, but limits sessions to 24 hours and requires you to manage scaling at higher volumes.</li>
<li><strong>Modal</strong> offers strong Python-centric workflows with gVisor isolation and massive autoscaling, but lacks BYOC options and on-prem deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Daytona</strong> delivers the fastest cold starts (sub-90ms) but uses Docker containers by default, weaker isolation than microVMs.</li>
</ul><p>For teams evaluating the <strong>best sandbox for AI code execution</strong>, this guide compares isolation strength, session limits, pricing, and platform completeness across the top providers.</p></div>

<p>Cursor alone generates nearly a billion lines of accepted code each day. AI coding assistants, autonomous agents, and LLM-powered applications are producing unprecedented volumes of code that needs a secure AI code sandbox to execute safely.</p>
<p>Running AI-generated code directly on your application servers, without a proper code execution sandbox**,** creates serious risks: it can expose secrets, overwhelm resources, escape container boundaries, or execute malicious operations, whether through bugs, hallucinations, or prompt injection attacks.</p>
<p>Purpose-built AI sandboxes solve three problems simultaneously:</p>
<p><strong>Security isolation:</strong> Containers or microVMs cut the blast radius of malicious or buggy code. A compromised sandbox can&#x27;t access your production databases or leak API keys.</p>
<p><strong>Ephemeral scale:</strong> Thousands of agent sessions can spin up and tear down in seconds without leaving idle infrastructure running up your bill.</p>
<p><strong>Observability and guardrails:</strong> Good sandbox platforms expose granular logs, metrics, and network controls so you can monitor and constrain what AI-generated code does.</p>

<p>When evaluating sandbox providers for AI agent workloads, focus on these criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolation technology:</strong> Does the AI sandbox platform use standard containers (shared kernel, weaker isolation), gVisor (user-space kernel interception), or microVMs like Firecracker and Kata Containers (dedicated kernel per workload)? For truly untrusted code, microVM isolation is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Startup latency:</strong> How fast can sandboxes spin up? Sub-second cold starts keep your agents responsive. Some platforms offer snapshot-based resume for even faster warm starts.</li>
<li><strong>Session duration:</strong> Can AI code execution sandboxes run for minutes, hours, or indefinitely? Many platforms impose strict time limits that break long-running agent workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Language and runtime flexibility:</strong> Are you locked to Python and JavaScript, or can you run any containerized workload? Can you bring custom images or must you use SDK-defined environments?</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure flexibility:</strong> Can you deploy in your own cloud (BYOC), on-premises, or only on the provider&#x27;s managed infrastructure? For regulated industries or data-sensitive applications, this matters.</li>
<li><strong>Networking controls:</strong> Can you define egress policies, set up tunnels for database connections, or lock down outbound access entirely?</li>
<li><strong>Platform completeness:</strong> Do you need just sandboxes, or will your AI application also require databases, backend APIs, GPU inference, and CI/CD? Starting with a complete platform avoids painful migrations.</li>

<p><strong>Multiple isolation technologies:</strong> Choose between Kata Containers with Cloud Hypervisor for true microVM isolation, or gVisor for user-space kernel protection. No other AI code execution sandbox platform offers this flexibility. Northflank&#x27;s engineering team actively contributes to Kata Containers, QEMU, containerd, and Cloud Hypervisor in the open-source community.</p>
<p><strong>Any OCI container image:</strong> Unlike platforms requiring SDK-defined images or proprietary formats, Northflank accepts any container from Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or private registries, without modification. Your existing images work immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited session duration:</strong> While E2B caps sessions at 24 hours and Vercel at 45 minutes to 5 hours, Northflank sandboxes persist until you terminate them. Critical for AI agents that maintain state across user interactions over days or weeks.</p>
<p><strong>True BYOC deployment:</strong> Deploy sandboxes in your AWS, GCP, Azure, or bare-metal infrastructure. Keep sensitive data in your VPC while Northflank handles orchestration. No other major sandbox platform offers production-ready bring-your-own-cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Complete platform:</strong> Northflank runs your entire AI application stack: sandboxed code execution, backend APIs, databases, scheduled jobs, and GPU workloads, with consistent security and orchestration. As your application grows beyond just sandboxes, your infrastructure grows with you.</p>
<p><strong>Production-proven at scale:</strong> Companies like Writer, Sentry, and cto.new run multi-tenant customer deployments for untrusted code on Northflank. When cto.new launched to 30,000+ users, their Northflank-powered sandbox infrastructure handled thousands of daily deployments without issues.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Docker isolation by default:</strong> Standard containers share the host kernel, weaker security than microVMs. Kata Containers available but not default.</li>
<li><strong>Young platform:</strong> Feature parity with established players still evolving</li>
<li><strong>Limited networking controls:</strong> No first-class tunneling or granular egress policies yet</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox-only focus:</strong> No broader infrastructure capabilities for databases, APIs, or GPU workloads</li>

<p>MicroVMs (Firecracker, Kata Containers) provide the strongest isolation because each workload gets its own dedicated kernel. Standard containers share the host kernel, creating potential escape vectors. gVisor sits in between, intercepting syscalls in user space. For truly untrusted AI-generated code, microVM isolation is recommended.</p>

<p>Many AI agents need to maintain state across extended user interactions, hours, days, or even weeks. Session limits of 45 minutes (Vercel) or 24 hours (E2B) force you to implement complex state serialization and restoration. Platforms with unlimited session duration like Northflank avoid this architectural complexity.</p>

<p>Some platforms support GPU-accelerated sandboxes for AI inference. Northflank offers NVIDIA H100, A100, and other GPUs with all-inclusive pricing. Modal also supports GPUs but charges separately for GPU, CPU, and RAM. Check whether your sandbox provider supports the specific GPU types your workloads require.</p>

<p>BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) means the platform runs its control plane but provisions resources in your cloud account, you get the operational benefits of a managed platform while keeping data in your VPC. Self-hosting means you run everything yourself, including the control plane. Northflank offers true BYOC; E2B&#x27;s self-hosting is still experimental.</p>

<p>Building sandbox infrastructure with Kubernetes, gVisor, or Firecracker is possible but requires significant engineering investment, typically months of work, plus ongoing operational burden. For most teams, a purpose-built platform provides better security, faster time-to-market, and lower total cost of ownership than rolling your own.</p>

For GPU workloads, Northflank&#x27;s all-inclusive pricing ($2.74/hour for H100) is approximately 62% cheaper than Modal&#x27;s separate billing for GPU, CPU, and RAM.</p></div></div><div class="sc-aXZVg ehgqRM"><div class="sc-aXZVg"><div class="sc-iGgWBj sc-fhzFiK HcgaU iOgJfs">Share this article with your network</div></div><a href="https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Northflank%20blog%20%E2%80%94%20What%E2%80%99s%20the%20best%20code%20execution%20sandbox%20for%20AI%20agents%20in%202026%3F&amp;url=https://northflank.com/blog/best-code-execution-sandbox-for-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share to X" class="sc-hknOHE fpswit"><svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:middle"><title>X</title><path d="M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?t=Northflank%20blog%20%E2%80%94%20What%E2%80%99s%20the%20best%20code%20execution%20sandbox%20for%20AI%20agents%20in%202026%3F&amp;u=https://northflank.com/blog/best-code-execution-sandbox-for-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share to Facebook" class="sc-hknOHE fpswit"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="32" width="32" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" fill="currentColor" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL"><path d="M13.397 20.997v-8.196h2.765l.411-3.209h-3.176V7.548c0-.926.258-1.56 1.587-1.56h1.684V3.127A22.336 22.336 0 0 0 14.201 3c-2.444 0-4.122 1.492-4.122 4.231v2.355H7.332v3.209h2.753v8.202h3.312z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;text=Northflank%20blog%20%E2%80%94%20What%E2%80%99s%20the%20best%20code%20execution%20sandbox%20for%20AI%20agents%20in%202026%3F&amp;url=https://northflank.com/blog/best-code-execution-sandbox-for-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share to LinkedIn" class="sc-hknOHE fpswit"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="32" width="32" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" fill="currentColor" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="StyledIconBase-sc-ea9ulj-0 ebjPRL"><circle cx="4.983" cy="5.009" r="2.188"></circle><path d="M9.237 8.855v12.139h3.769v-6.003c0-1.584.298-3.118 2.262-3.118 1.937 0 1.961 1.811 1.961 3.218v5.904H21v-6.657c0-3.27-.704-5.783-4.526-5.783-1.835 0-3.065 1.007-3.568 1.96h-.051v-1.66H9.237zm-6.142 0H6.87v12.139H3.095z"></path></svg></a></div><div class="sc-aXZVg ehgqRM"><div class="sc-iGgWBj sc-fhzFiK hOdyLT iOgJfs">Related posts</div><div class="sc-kAyceB fqkdHn"><div class="sc-aXZVg hSMypA"><a href="/blog/top-blaxel-alternatives-for-ai-sandbox-and-agent-infrastructure"><span class="sc-Nxspf hytOMe"><div class="sc-aXZVg cdfEZl"><div class="sc-aXZVg sc-fXSgeo  dZwKWf"><img class="Dr" alt="" src="https://assets.northflank.com/self_hostable_alternatives_to_daytona_3c53fca4b4.png?auto=avif&amp;fit=crop&amp;quality=90&amp;width=820&amp;height=461" width="820px" height="461px" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 820px) calc(100vw -
