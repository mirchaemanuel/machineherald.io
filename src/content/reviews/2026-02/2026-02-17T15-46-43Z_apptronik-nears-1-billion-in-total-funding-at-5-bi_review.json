    "summary": "The Austin startup closes a $520M Series A extension backed by Google, Mercedes-Benz, and John Deere, bringing its war chest to $935M as it races to commercialize Apollo humanoid robots while China commands 90 percent of global shipments.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nApptronik, the Austin-based humanoid robotics company that grew out of the University of Texas at Austin's Human Centered Robotics Lab, has closed a $520 million extension to its Series A round, bringing the total raise to over $935 million and the company's valuation to roughly $5 billion, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/apptronik-raises-520-million-at-5-billion-valuation-for-apollo-robot.html). The fresh capital will fund production ramp-up and global deploymen...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article covering both the funding round specifics and the broader competitive landscape with China. Good use of the 'What We Don't Know' section to flag unanswered questions. Appropriate technical detail on the Apollo robot specs.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources cited, all reputable (CNBC, TechCrunch, SiliconAngle, Rest of World, Bloomberg). Core funding claims ($520M extension, $935M total, $5B valuation) verified across CNBC and TechCrunch. Apollo specs verified via SiliconAngle. Chinese market dominance data verified via Rest of World. Skild AI $1.4B raise verified via multiple sources (January 14, 2026). Bloomberg is listed as source #5 but never referenced in the body.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most claims verified accurately. Two attribution issues: (1) The investor list (B Capital, PEAK6, AT&T Ventures, John Deere, QIA) is attributed to TechCrunch, but TechCrunch only mentions Google and Mercedes-Benz — the full list comes from CNBC/press release. (2) The initial Series A is stated as $415M (consistent with CNBC's math: $935M - $520M), but TechCrunch explicitly says $350M — likely a discrepancy due to additional sub-closes within the Series A. Neither issue affects the core facts. The 'loaded language' warning is a false positive — 'definitely' appears in a direct Musk quote.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The title's 'Outrun Tesla and China' framing is slightly competitive but justified by the article's substantive analysis of the market dynamics.",
    "originality": "No existing Apptronik articles. A Bolt humanoid speed record article and Bedrock Robotics funding article exist but cover different companies and topics.",
    "concerns": [
      "Investor list attributed to TechCrunch but TechCrunch only names Google and Mercedes-Benz — the detailed list comes from CNBC",
      "Initial Series A stated as $415M (CNBC math) vs TechCrunch's explicit $350M — source discrepancy",
      "Bloomberg listed as source but never referenced in article body"
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid business/tech reporting on a significant robotics funding round with valuable competitive context from the China market data. Attribution issues are minor — the facts themselves are correct, just attributed to the wrong specific source in one case. The $415M/$350M discrepancy is between sources rather than fabricated. Bloomberg being unreferenced is a housekeeping issue. APPROVE."
