## Overview

Europe's Ariane 6 rocket flew its most powerful configuration for the first time on February 12, deploying 32 Amazon Leo broadband satellites in the heaviest payload a European launcher has ever carried. Designated VA267 by [Arianespace](https://newsroom.arianespace.com/arianespace-successfully-launches-32-amazon-leo-satellites-with-the-first-ariane-64/), the mission lifted off from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana at 13:45 local time (16:45 GMT) and placed all 32 spacecraft in low Earth orbit at approximately 465 kilometers altitude within one hour and 54 minutes.

The flight marks the sixth launch of the Ariane 6 rocket overall, the first to use the four-booster "64" variant, and the first commercial customer mission for the vehicle, according to [Space.com](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/ariane-64-rocket-debut-launch-amazon-leo-internet-satellites). It was Arianespace's 359th launch.

## The Ariane 64 Configuration

The Ariane 62 — the baseline variant with two solid rocket boosters — can carry 10.3 tonnes to low Earth orbit. By strapping on four P120C solid-propellant motors instead of two, the Ariane 64 more than doubles that capacity to 21.6 tonnes, according to [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/More_power_first_Ariane_6_with_four_boosters_lifts_off). The VA267 payload weighed roughly 20 metric tonnes, making it the heaviest ever launched by a European rocket.

The launcher also debuted a new 20-meter-tall long fairing — the tallest Ariane 6 fairing built — bringing the vehicle's total height to 62 meters, roughly equivalent to a 20-story building, per [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/More_power_first_Ariane_6_with_four_boosters_lifts_off).

"With the powerful roar of four boosters at liftoff, comes more than double the payload mass to orbit," said ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher, as quoted by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/More_power_first_Ariane_6_with_four_boosters_lifts_off). Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA's Director of Space Transportation, said the launch sustains Europe's autonomous access to space across its complete rocket fleet.

## First of 18 Amazon Leo Launches

The mission, designated LE-01 (Leo Europe 01) by Amazon, is the first of 18 Ariane 6 launches contracted to deploy the Amazon Leo satellite constellation, according to [Arianespace](https://newsroom.arianespace.com/arianespace-successfully-launches-32-amazon-leo-satellites-with-the-first-ariane-64/). Amazon Leo — formerly known as Project Kuiper before being rebranded in November 2025 — is the company's broadband internet constellation, designed to deliver high-speed connectivity to underserved areas worldwide.

Arianespace CEO David Cavaillolès said the successful flight "marks a major milestone" and demonstrates Europe's "ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale constellation missions," according to [Arianespace](https://newsroom.arianespace.com/arianespace-successfully-launches-32-amazon-leo-satellites-with-the-first-ariane-64/).

Amazon has now launched more than 150 Leo satellites since April 2025 using a variety of launch providers. Just two days before the Ariane 64 flight, the FCC approved 4,500 additional satellites, expanding the authorized constellation from roughly 3,200 to 7,700 spacecraft, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/amazon-gets-fcc-approval-to-launch-4500-leo-internet-satellites.html). However, Amazon faces a regulatory deadline to deploy 1,600 of its first-generation satellites by July 2026 and has asked the FCC to extend that cutoff to July 2028.

## The Starlink Gap

Amazon Leo enters a market dominated by SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and approximately nine million customers. Amazon has said it plans to begin commercial service in five countries, including the United States, in early 2026, though the scale gap remains substantial.

The Ariane 6 contract gives Amazon a launch provider outside the SpaceX ecosystem, alongside existing deals with United Launch Alliance's Vulcan, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and India's GSLV. Diversifying across multiple rockets reduces schedule risk, particularly for a constellation that must meet FCC deployment milestones.

## What We Don't Know

- Whether Amazon will meet its July 2026 deadline to deploy 1,600 first-generation satellites, or whether the FCC will grant the requested extension to 2028.
- How Amazon Leo's service quality and pricing will compare to Starlink once commercial operations begin.
- Whether the Ariane 64's performance on this maiden flight fully validated all parameters or if any anomalies occurred during ascent or satellite deployment.

## What Comes Next

Arianespace plans further Ariane 6 production improvements through 2026, according to ArianeGroup CEO Martin Sion, as quoted by [Arianespace](https://newsroom.arianespace.com/arianespace-successfully-launches-32-amazon-leo-satellites-with-the-first-ariane-64/). Future upgrades include replacing the current P120C boosters with larger P160C motors carrying 14 tonnes of additional fuel, which will further increase the rocket's payload capacity, per [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/More_power_first_Ariane_6_with_four_boosters_lifts_off). With 17 more Amazon Leo launches under contract, the Ariane 64 will face its first sustained cadence test as Europe's heaviest operational launcher.
