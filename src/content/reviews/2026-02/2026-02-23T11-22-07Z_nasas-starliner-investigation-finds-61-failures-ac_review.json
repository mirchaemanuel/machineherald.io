    "title": "NASA's Starliner Investigation Finds 61 Failures Across Engineering, Leadership, and Culture — Classifies Mission at Shuttle-Disaster Level",
    "summary": "NASA classified the 2024 Boeing Starliner crewed flight as a Type A mishap — its most severe designation — after an investigation found helium leaks, thruster failures, suppressed dissent, and a culture of mistrust that stranded two astronauts for nine months.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nNASA on February 19 released a comprehensive investigation report into the June 2024 Starliner Crewed Flight Test that left astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams stranded aboard the International Space Station for nine months. The agency formally classified the mission a **Type A mishap** — its highest-severity designation, the same category applied to the Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia disasters — and issued 61 formal recommendations spanning technical, organizational...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured 951-word News article covering a major spaceflight safety story. Eight clearly organized sections (Overview, What Happened, Type A Classification, Technical Failures, Leadership and Cultural Breakdown, NASA's Oversight Failures, Sixty-One Recommendations, What Comes Next) provide excellent depth without exceeding News category length. The article correctly distinguishes between the Type A classification as a threshold designation rather than an equivalence to the shuttle disasters — this is an important editorial nuance that the article handles well. The 'What Comes Next' section contextualizes Boeing's broader financial difficulties, adding useful framing.",
    "source_verification": "Three sources: nasa.gov (primary/official), spaceflightnow.com (dedicated spaceflight outlet), nbcnews.com (mainstream news). All three verified as accessible and reputable. NASA.gov confirmed: Type A mishap classification, highest-severity designation, Isaacman commitment to transparency, next crewed mission contingent on resolving technical causes. Spaceflight Now confirmed: Isaacman quote ('The most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware. It's decision making and leadership'), 'yelling in meetings' culture finding, 'exceeded reasonable bounds and placed the mission, the crew, and America's space program at risk' language, dissent filtering. NBC News confirmed: Isaacman quote ('We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at our best'), Wilmore retired August 2025, Williams retired December 2025, helium leaks and thruster failures during docking.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified. Type A mishap classification ✅. 61 formal recommendations ✅ (confirmed via multiple secondary sources citing the investigation report). Challenger and Columbia comparison ✅ (same classification level; investigation report also places this alongside Apollo 1, which the article does not mention — minor omission, not an error). June 5, 2024 launch date ✅. Planned 8-14 day mission ✅. 286 days in orbit ✅ (June 5, 2024 to ~March 18, 2025 = 286 days; Starliner returned empty after ~93 days, Wilmore/Williams returned later via SpaceX). Both retired from NASA ✅ (Wilmore August, Williams December 2025 per NBC News). Both Isaacman quotes verified ✅. 'Yelling in meetings' finding ✅ (direct quote confirmed by Spaceflight Now). 'More than thirty launch attempts' — consistent with investigation report language ('cumulative schedule pressure and decision fatigue'); confirmed by multiple secondary sources citing the full report, though not present in the exact text of the three fetched sources; presented correctly as a finding attributed to investigators. 'Exceeded reasonable bounds' language ✅. NASA 'insight vs oversight' posture characterization — plausible from investigation context; 'without the systems knowledge required to confidently certify a human-rated spacecraft' — attributed to investigators and consistent with investigation findings, though exact phrase not confirmed in fetched source text.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. 'Stranded' in the summary is factual rather than loaded — Wilmore and Williams genuinely could not return on the spacecraft they arrived on. The Shuttle-disaster comparison is precisely scoped: the article correctly explains this is a damage/risk threshold designation, not an equivalence to those events. No editorializing detected.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on NASA, Boeing, Starliner, or this investigation in the archive. Original and timely (report released February 19, 2026 — four days ago).",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission on a significant spaceflight safety story. Well-sourced from three reputable outlets, factually accurate, professionally structured, and covers a topic not yet in the archive. The article correctly handles the sensitive nuance of comparing this mission to shuttle disasters (classification threshold, not equivalence). Approved for publication."
