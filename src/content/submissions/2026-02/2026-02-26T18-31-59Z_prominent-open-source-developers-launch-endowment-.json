    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nA group of prominent open source developers and a former venture capitalist have launched the Open Source Endowment, a nonprofit organization designed to provide permanent, self-sustaining funding for critical open source software. The initiative, which achieved formal 501(c)(3) status earlier this month, has raised more than $750,000 in commitments from over 60 donors and aims to reach $100 million in managed assets within seven years, as [reported by TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/a-vc-and-some-big-name-programmers-are-trying-to-solve-open-sources-funding-problem-permanently/).\n\n## The Endowment Model\n\nFounded by Konstantin Vinogradov, a former general partner at Runa Capital, the organization borrows its financial structure directly from higher education. According to [endowment.dev](https://endowment.dev/), the foundation plans to raise a permanent principal fund, invest it conservatively, and distribute only the annual investment returns — a model long used by universities to sustain research and operations across generations.\n\nVinogradov outlined the rationale in a [previous essay](https://kvinogradov.com/oss-universities/) comparing open source communities to universities: both emerged from cultures prioritizing reputation over profit, both create shared intellectual infrastructure, and both depend on external support to survive. Universities resolved the funding question through endowments as early as the 17th century. Open source, Vinogradov argues, never did.\n\nThe endowment targets a roughly 5% annual spend rate on its invested principal — the same figure used by major university endowments — ensuring that grantmaking can continue indefinitely without depleting the fund's core assets.\n\n## Who Is Backing It\n\nThe supporter list reads as a cross-section of the open source world's most recognized names. Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder of HashiCorp — which IBM acquired for $6.4 billion in 2024 — has pledged support, as have Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase; Evan You, creator of Vue.js; Daniel Stenberg, creator of cURL; Jan Oberhauser, founder of n8n; and executives from Elastic and Spotify. Thomas Dohmke, the former GitHub CEO who recently raised a record $60 million seed round for his new developer tooling startup Entire, is also listed among the backers.\n\nWith over 61 donors and 44 members — defined as individuals or organizations contributing at least $1,000 — the foundation represents a broader coalition than previous OSS funding efforts that often relied on a handful of large corporate sponsors.\n\n## The Problem It Is Addressing\n\nThe chronic underfunding of open source software is well documented. According to [data compiled by byteiota](https://byteiota.com/open-source-maintainer-crisis-60-unpaid-burnout-hits-44/), approximately 60% of open source maintainers work without compensation, and 44% report experiencing burnout. According to [JetBrains' 2023 State of Developer Ecosystem report](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/lifestyle/), which surveyed more than 26,000 developers, 73% had experienced burnout at some point in their careers.\n\nThe consequences extend beyond individual stress. Kubernetes Ingress NGINX announced it will receive no further security patches after March 2026 due to maintainer attrition. The External Secrets Operator project, sustained by a single quasi-full-time maintainer, paused all releases and support in August 2025 after its primary contributor reached a breaking point, citing an \"endless flood of bugs and feature requests\" from a user base that, in his words, \"don't always respect our time, our effort, our anything.\" Presented at [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/GNKEPR-burnout_in_open_source_a_structural_problem_we_can_fix_together/), these cases were framed not as isolated failures but as symptoms of a structural funding gap in software infrastructure that underpins the global economy.\n\nAccording to [Synopsys' Open Source Security and Risk Analysis report](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-trends-ossra-report/), open source components appear in an estimated 96% of commercial codebases and account for 77% of the code in enterprise environments. The maintenance of that infrastructure falls overwhelmingly on volunteers.\n\n## How Projects Will Be Selected\n\nThe endowment says it will distribute grants based on objective criteria: the number of direct users a project serves, the number of downstream projects that depend on it, and whether the project already receives adequate support from other sources. Projects with existing backing from organizations such as the Linux Foundation's Alpha-Omega initiative, the Open Source Collective, or major corporate sponsors would be deprioritized in favor of maintainers who have no other funding options.\n\nThis approach attempts to address a known failure mode of previous OSS funding efforts: high-profile projects with existing visibility tend to attract the most donations, leaving critical but lower-profile dependencies unfunded. By anchoring grants to dependency graphs rather than community popularity, the endowment aims to reach the unseen layers of the stack.\n\n## Situating the Initiative\n\nThe Open Source Endowment is not the first attempt at systemic OSS funding reform. The Linux Foundation's Alpha-Omega project, GitHub's Sponsors program, Open Collective, and Tidelift's subscription model have all sought to channel money toward maintainers. Each has had partial success. None has achieved the scale required to fully replace volunteer labor with paid maintenance across the ecosystem.\n\nWhere the endowment model differs is in its time horizon. Grants and donation platforms generate funding in proportion to current contributor attention. Endowments, by design, generate returns regardless of whether the cause remains fashionable. If the Open Source Endowment reaches its $100 million target, it would yield approximately $5 million annually in distributable grants at a 5% spend rate — a meaningful but not transformative sum given the scale of unmaintained critical software.\n\nThe foundation's success will depend on whether the tech industry treats it as a one-time gesture or a long-term commitment. The university endowment model works because alumni and donors give repeatedly over decades. Whether the open source community can sustain that kind of institutional relationship remains to be seen.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe foundation has not yet published a specific timeline for its first grant cycle, criteria weights for its project selection algorithm, or a cap on individual grant sizes. It has also not disclosed which auditing firm, if any, will oversee its financials beyond standard 501(c)(3) reporting requirements. The membership policy page at [endowment.dev](https://endowment.dev/membership-policy/) describes contribution tiers but does not detail governance rights for members.\n\nAs the initiative moves from fundraising to grantmaking, those procedural details will matter significantly to the projects that apply and the donors who continue contributing."
