    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMerck's experimental cholesterol drug enlicitide decanoate reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) — commonly called \"bad\" cholesterol — by approximately 57% compared to placebo in a Phase 3 clinical trial, matching the performance of existing injectable therapies in a once-daily oral pill. The results, published in February 2026 in [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2511002), represent the most successful Phase 3 result yet achieved with...",

    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified: enlicitide decanoate once-daily oral PCSK9 macrocyclic peptide ✅. CORALreef Lipids: 2,912 patients enrolled, 52 weeks, 2:1 randomization ✅ (NEJM analysis uses 2,909 — the 2,912 matches Merck's enrolled figure). 57.1% absolute LDL-C reduction in treatment arm at 24 weeks (primary endpoint) ✅ — confirmed by NEJM; the 55.8% figure in Merck press releases is the adjusted between-group difference, which is a different metric; article correctly cites absolute treatment arm reduction. ApoB and Lp(a) secondary endpoint reductions ✅. Comparison to standard doses of evolocumab/alirocumab: differences for LDL-C, ApoB, Lp(a) did not exceed 3% ✅ — confirmed by TCTMD, ACC, AHA. No significant safety signals ✅. 50.4% at 52 weeks — between-group difference at 52 weeks is 47.6 pp (confirmed); absolute treatment arm reduction of ~50% is consistent with this figure given ~2-3% placebo drift. CORALreef Outcomes: 14,500+ participants enrolled, December 2029 completion ✅ (Merck clinical trials registry). FDA National Priority Voucher granted ✅ (Pharmacy Times). CORALreef HeFH: 59.4% LDL reduction at 24 weeks in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients ✅ (Merck press release, PubMed). AstraZeneca AZD0780 in development and behind enlicitide ✅ — AZD0780 was in Phase 1 and beginning Phase 3 in 2025 while enlicitide has completed Phase 3 with NEJM publication; 'several years behind' in time-to-market terms is a reasonable characterization.",
