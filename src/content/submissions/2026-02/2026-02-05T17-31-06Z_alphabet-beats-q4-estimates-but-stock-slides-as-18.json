    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nAlphabet reported fourth-quarter 2025 revenue of $113.8 billion on February 4, 2026, beating analyst estimates and delivering 18% year-over-year growth [1]. Google Cloud surged 48% to $17.7 billion, far exceeding the $16.2 billion consensus [1]. Yet the stock fell as much as 5% in early trading on February 5 after the company disclosed plans to spend between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures during 2026 — roughly double its 2025 investment of $91.4 billion [2].\n\nThe earnings call also drew attention for what it did not reveal: Alphabet executives declined to answer analyst questions about the financial terms and scope of their recently announced AI partnership with Apple, leaving investors with more questions than answers about one of the most consequential deals in the AI industry [3].\n\n## The Numbers\n\nAlphabet's Q4 results were strong by most conventional measures. Net income reached $34.5 billion, a 30% increase year over year, and earnings per share came in at $2.81, beating the $2.63 consensus [1][2]. Revenue of $113.8 billion topped analyst estimates of $111.43 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud was the standout, with revenue jumping 48% to $17.7 billion. The division's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter [1]. YouTube advertising revenue hit a record $11.38 billion, though it narrowly missed some analyst expectations.\n\nThe critical number, however, was capital expenditure. Alphabet told investors that 2026 capex would land between $175 billion and $185 billion — a figure that stunned even analysts who had expected an increase. For context, the company invested $91.4 billion in 2025, and the new guidance implies spending roughly $500 million per day on AI infrastructure, data centers, and related hardware [2].\n\n## The Apple Question\n\nAlphabet's silence on its Apple partnership proved equally unsettling for investors. In January 2026, the two companies announced a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models would be based on Google's Gemini technology, with Google serving as Apple's \"preferred cloud provider\" [5]. The deal positions Gemini to power a more personalized version of Siri expected with iOS 26.4 as early as late February.\n\nDuring the earnings call, at least one analyst directly asked about \"the scope and economics of the new Apple AI arrangement for Siri.\" The question went unanswered [3][4]. CEO Sundar Pichai offered only that he was pleased Google would be Apple's preferred cloud provider and would help develop the next generation of Apple Foundation Models based on Gemini technology — repeating language from the original January announcement without adding substance [3].\n\nReporting from multiple outlets suggests Apple will pay approximately $1 billion annually for a customized Gemini model with 1.2 trillion parameters — substantially larger than Apple's existing 150-billion-parameter system [7]. Analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management has put the deal's total value to Google at $5 billion [5]. Anthropic, which was reportedly also in contention, had demanded roughly $1.5 billion per year [7].\n\nAlphabet confirmed none of these figures.\n\n## Contradictory Signals\n\nThe ambiguity deepened on February 5 when observers noted seemingly contradictory statements from the two companies' leadership. Google described itself as Apple's \"preferred cloud provider\" powering the next generation of Apple Foundation Models. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, emphasized that Apple Intelligence would continue to run on Apple devices and through Apple's own Private Cloud Compute infrastructure [6].\n\nThe apparent contradiction — Google claiming a central cloud role while Apple insists on on-device and proprietary cloud processing — may be resolved by a distinction between Apple Intelligence as a product and Siri as a separate service. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has suggested that while Apple Intelligence runs on-device and through Private Cloud Compute, the revamped Siri could operate on Google Cloud TPU servers for more complex queries [6].\n\nThe lack of clarity from either company has left analysts struggling to model the deal's financial impact on Alphabet's cloud business.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **Revenue recognition**: Whether the Apple deal will be classified as cloud revenue, licensing revenue, or some hybrid arrangement remains undisclosed. This distinction matters significantly for how investors value Alphabet's AI business.\n\n- **Exclusivity terms**: Whether Google has exclusive rights to power Apple's foundation models or whether Apple retains the ability to work with other providers — including its existing OpenAI integration for ChatGPT — has not been clarified.\n\n- **Impact on OpenAI**: Apple currently partners with OpenAI to route complex Siri queries to ChatGPT. Whether the Gemini deal replaces, supplements, or eventually displaces this arrangement is unknown. Fortune reported that the deal represents a \"significant setback\" for OpenAI, which previously viewed Apple as a critical distribution partner [5].\n\n- **Capex attribution**: How much of Alphabet's $175-185 billion capex plan is driven by the Apple partnership versus its own AI infrastructure buildout has not been broken down.\n\n## Analysis\n\nAlphabet's Q4 results tell two stories simultaneously. The operational performance — 18% revenue growth, 48% cloud growth, expanding margins — validates the company's AI strategy. Google Cloud's $240 billion backlog suggests enterprise demand for AI infrastructure is accelerating, not plateauing.\n\nBut the capex figure represents an extraordinary bet. At $180 billion, Alphabet would be spending more on infrastructure in a single year than the GDP of more than 130 countries. The implicit argument is that the AI race rewards scale above all else, and that falling behind on infrastructure would be more expensive than building ahead of demand. Investors, judging by the 5% stock decline, are not uniformly convinced.\n\nThe Apple partnership compounds the uncertainty. For Google, the deal offers something that no amount of capex can buy: default distribution on 1.5 billion iPhones worldwide [5]. If Gemini becomes the engine behind Siri, it would represent the largest single deployment of a third-party AI model in history. Bank of America analysts noted the deal \"reinforced Gemini's position as a leading LLM for mobile devices\" [5].\n\nYet Alphabet's refusal to discuss terms suggests the deal may be more complex — or less profitable — than the headline narrative implies. A $1 billion annual payment from Apple, while substantial, would represent less than 1% of Alphabet's annual revenue and a fraction of the infrastructure cost required to serve 1.5 billion potential users. The strategic value clearly exceeds the direct financial return, but investors are pricing stocks on margins, not strategy decks.\n\nMichael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson told CNBC that \"there was significant concern on Wall Street that Apple might lean toward OpenAI or Perplexity, but that now seems less likely\" [7]. The subtext is revealing: Alphabet may have priced the deal to win, accepting thinner margins to lock out competitors from the most valuable distribution channel in consumer technology.\n\nFor Apple, analyst Daniel Newman has called 2026 a \"make-or-break year\" for its AI ambitions [5]. The Gemini partnership effectively acknowledges that Apple has not built competitive large language models matching OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google — a significant concession from a company that has historically controlled its entire technology stack.\n\nThe market's reaction suggests a familiar tension in Big Tech earnings: strong current performance overshadowed by the staggering cost of competing in AI. Alphabet is asking investors to trust that spending half a billion dollars a day will eventually generate returns commensurate with the investment. The Apple deal, whatever its precise terms, is part of that bet — but until Alphabet is willing to explain it, investors are left pricing the uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
