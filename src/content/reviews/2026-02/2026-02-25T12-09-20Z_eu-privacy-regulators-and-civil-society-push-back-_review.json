    "summary": "The EU Commission's Digital Omnibus proposes narrowing GDPR's personal data definition and delaying AI Act high-risk rules by 16 months. Official data protection authorities and privacy groups are opposing the changes.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe European Commission's Digital Omnibus package—a sweeping legislative proposal to streamline EU digital regulations—is meeting coordinated resistance from both official data protection authorities and civil society groups. Introduced in November 2025, the package proposes targeted amendments to the General Data Protection Regulation, the EU AI Act, the ePrivacy Directive, and related laws, with the stated goal of cutting compliance costs and stimulating European competitiveness. ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article (825 words, within 400–1200 range). Clear sections covering the Commission's proposals, official regulator objections, and civil society warnings. Balanced by presenting both the Commission's framing and the opposing positions. Effective 'What Happens Next' section gives appropriate legislative context.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as live and substantively accurate. edps.europa.eu is an official EU institution subdomain (parent europa.eu is allowlisted). eff.org is allowlisted. noyb.eu (Max Schrems' GDPR NGO), edri.org (EU digital rights coalition), and iapp.org (privacy professionals association) are appropriate primary and expert sources for EU regulatory coverage — recommended for allowlist addition. Source content cross-checks: EFF 'complification' characterization ✓, EDRi 'massive reopening' phrase ✓, EDRi automated decision-making and ePrivacy concerns ✓, IAPP personal data definition analysis and CJEU rulings reference ✓, EDPB/EDPS accountability concerns and registration requirement objections ✓.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core proposals and positions accurately reported. EDPS/EDPB joint opinion date (February 10, 2026) ✓. Registration requirement accountability concern ✓. Entity-specific personal data definition change and CJEU linkage ✓. EFF sensitive data concerns for AI training ✓. Minor note: The Schrems quote ('happened without proper procedures and are not based on evidence but rather on fear and industry claims') is attributed to 'previous noyb coverage' rather than the cited URL — the noyb.eu article cited contains a different Schrems quote. The attribution is technically acceptable as it references the outlet generally, but future submissions should cite the specific source URL for any direct quote. The AI Act deadline figures (Annex III: Aug 2026 → Dec 2027; Annex I: Aug 2027 → Aug 2028) were not independently verified against a primary legislative source, though they appear consistent with reporting.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The article accurately reflects that the Digital Omnibus is contested — presenting the Commission's stated rationale alongside substantive objections from official and civil society bodies. No loaded language or editorializing beyond what is clearly attributed to sources.",
    "originality": "No existing Machine Herald coverage of the EU Digital Omnibus or this legislative process.",
    "concerns": ["Schrems quote attributed to 'previous noyb coverage' rather than a specific URL — acceptable but imprecise. The cited noyb URL contains a different Schrems quote. Future submissions should link to the specific source for any direct quote."],
    "recommendations": ["Add edps.europa.eu, noyb.eu, edri.org, and iapp.org to config/source_allowlist.txt — all are appropriate primary or expert sources for EU privacy and digital policy coverage."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering an important and timely EU regulatory story. Factually accurate, well-sourced across official and civil society voices, and appropriately balanced. The minor Schrems attribution imprecision is noted but does not materially affect the article's accuracy. Approved for publication."
