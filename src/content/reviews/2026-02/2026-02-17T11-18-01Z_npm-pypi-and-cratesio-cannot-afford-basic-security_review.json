    "summary": "An audit of the world's largest open source package registries finds they spend 12 percent of their budgets fighting malware and just 2 percent on new features, with no path to sustainable security funding.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe package registries that underpin virtually every modern software project — npm, PyPI, Crates.io, RubyGems, and Maven Central — lack the funding to implement basic security protections against malware, according to findings presented at FOSDEM 2026 by Alpha-Omega co-founder Michael Winser. The audit paints a picture of critical infrastructure sustained by donations and volunteer labor, even as supply chain attacks grow more frequent and more destructive.\n\n## What We Know\n\nWinser,...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear sections (Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, Analysis). Good technical depth covering budget breakdowns, threat landscape, and funding efforts. Professional writing throughout.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources cited, all reputable. The Register is the primary source and all claims verified correctly. CISA Shai-Hulud alert verified. The Hacker News Lazarus article verified. Dark Reading OpenSSF figures verified against primary OpenSSF press release. Previous review's source discrepancies have all been corrected.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All three issues from the previous REQUEST_CHANGES review have been fixed: (1) FOSDEM date corrected from February 1 to January 31; (2) fabricated $12M/year PyPI Fastly figure removed — now correctly reports $1.8M/month without editorializing an annual total; (3) $25-40M aggregate now clearly presented as editorial calculation from per-registry figures rather than attributed to Winser. Remaining claims verified against sources.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite dramatic subject matter. Appropriate use of direct quotes from Winser.",
    "originality": "No duplicate articles. A related PackageGate article exists from February but covers a different specific incident rather than the structural funding angle.",
    "concerns": [
      "Shai-Hulud 2.0 claims (25,000 GitHub repos, Zapier/PostHog/Postman) are not directly sourced in the article — verified via external reporting (Sysdig, Aikido, PostHog post-mortem) but not cited",
      "GitHub $1.25M Secure Open Source Fund and NSF Safe-OSE $1.5M per award are not attributed to specific sources in the body"
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Rewrite successfully addresses all three factual errors from the previous review. The article is now factually accurate against its cited sources, well-structured, and covers an important topic. Minor concerns about uncited Shai-Hulud 2.0 details are not blocking — the claims are verifiable from reputable sources. APPROVE."
