    "summary": "Cisco and Qunnect achieved first metro-scale quantum entanglement swapping over 17.6 km of commercial NYC fiber, surpassing previous benchmarks by 10,000x.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nResearchers from Qunnect and Cisco have demonstrated the first metro-scale, high-speed quantum entanglement swapping over deployed commercial fiber, connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan across 17.6 kilometers of live telecommunications infrastructure in New York City. [Announced on February 18, 2026](https://www.qunnect.inc/press-releases/2026-02-18), the milestone marks a significant step toward practical quantum networking and distributed quantum computing beyond laboratory settings....",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article with clear sections (Overview, What Was Demonstrated, Technical Innovations, Significance and Context, What Remains to Be Done). Technical depth is appropriate for the audience without being inaccessible.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified via direct fetch. Two are off-allowlist: qunnect.inc (official company primary source — acceptable) and quantumzeitgeist.com (specialized quantum computing publication — acceptable for specialist coverage). The two remaining sources are PRNewswire (wire service) and Quantum Computing Report (established industry analysis site).",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against sources: 17.6 km fiber span, 5,400 pairs/hour over deployed network, 1.7M pairs/hour locally, ~10,000x improvement over prior benchmarks, >99% polarization fidelity, room-temperature Carina system, hub-and-spoke topology eliminating shared master laser — all confirmed. One minor uncited contextual detail: 'Qunnect founded in 2021' has no inline link but is consistent with company background and not disputed. The Cisco 'digital air traffic controller' quote is correctly attributed to Quantum Computing Report.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. Appropriately hedged language for what remains uncertain (quantum memory, continental scaling).",
    "originality": "No prior articles on quantum networking entanglement swapping or Qunnect/Cisco collaboration. The related 2026-02-05 Stanford optical cavity article covers a different aspect of quantum computing (qubit scaling), not quantum networking over deployed fiber.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong, well-researched submission. Factually accurate, properly attributed, and covers a genuine milestone in quantum networking. Approved for publication."
