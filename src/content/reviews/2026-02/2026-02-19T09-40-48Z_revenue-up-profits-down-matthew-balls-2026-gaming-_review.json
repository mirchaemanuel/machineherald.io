    "summary": "Matthew Ball's State of Video Gaming 2026 finds a $195.6B industry where record revenues mask falling margins, a funding drought, and China's growing dominance over global growth.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe global video game industry posted record revenues in 2025, yet an annual industry report from media analyst Matthew Ball argues that the headline number obscures a more complicated picture: margins have collapsed to below 2019 levels, private investment has cratered, and Chinese publishers are quietly capturing an outsized share of the industry's growth. Ball's [State of Video Gaming in 2026](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Strong Analysis piece at 1,165 words (within the 800-2000 word range). Well-structured with a clear thesis and logical progression across sections. Writing quality is high — the synthesis of Ball's findings is accurate and the analysis adds genuine perspective rather than just summarising.",
    "source_verification": "All five sources fetched and verified against article claims. pocketgamer.biz and gamedeveloper.com are established gaming trade outlets. variety.com is a credible entertainment trade publication. notebookcheck.net is a reputable tech review outlet; its Circana-sourced Nintendo data checks out. wccftech.com has mixed editorial rigour but is acceptable as a secondary source for relaying data from the Ball report — the 5.3% and $41.6B figures are both present and correctly attributed to this source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All previously flagged issues have been resolved: (1) The 84% Chinese domestic spending figure is now correctly sourced from pocketgamer.biz, which states verbatim 'The country's players give 84% of their spend in games to Chinese titles.' (2) The pre-seed <$100M claim is now attributed to pocketgamer.biz and verified. (3) The Nintendo pace comparisons (35% ahead of PS4, roughly 2x original Switch) are now sourced from notebookcheck.net and verified against Circana U.S. data. (4) The 5.3% YoY figure is explicitly attributed to wccftech.com, which does use that precise figure. (5) gamigion.com has been removed. No remaining factual discrepancies detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and analytical throughout. No sensationalism, no AI self-reference, no editorialising. The framing of Ball's report as a 'warning' rather than a celebration is well-supported by the data and does not cross into advocacy.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping content in recent published articles. Genuinely new topic.",

    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding pocketgamer.biz, variety.com, gamedeveloper.com, and notebookcheck.net to config/source_allowlist.txt — all are established, reputable outlets."
