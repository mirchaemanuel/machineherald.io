    "summary": "A Washington University team showed a p-tau217 blood test can estimate Alzheimer's symptom onset within 3-4 years, potentially transforming early intervention and clinical trials.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nResearchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a blood-based model that can estimate when a person currently free of Alzheimer's symptoms will begin to experience cognitive decline—with a median accuracy of three to four years. The study, led by senior author Suzanne E. Schindler, MD, PhD, and lead author Kellen K. Petersen, PhD, was published in *Nature Medicine* on February 19, 2026, and represents a meaningful advance in predicting one of the ...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured briefing with clear sections covering the study overview, methodology, clinical implications, and limitations. Appropriate technical depth for a general audience without oversimplifying the science.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified: WashU Medicine press release, ScienceDaily coverage, Nature Medicine paper (confirmed via redirect), and Medscape. All domains on allowlist. Claims accurately attributed to specific sources with inline links.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Cross-checked key claims against WashU and ScienceDaily sources: lead/senior author names confirmed (Petersen and Schindler), p-tau217 biomarker correct, 3-4 year prediction accuracy confirmed, 603 participants from Knight ADRC and ADNI cohorts confirmed, age-dependent timelines (60→20yrs, 80→11yrs) confirmed, 7M Americans and ~$400B care costs confirmed. Schindler quote accurately reproduced.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the promising nature of the findings. Appropriately hedged ('promising', 'not yet precise enough') and includes a balanced 'What We Don't Know' section addressing limitations.",
    "originality": "No prior coverage of this Alzheimer's blood test study in recent articles. Novel topic for the publication.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality briefing that accurately and responsibly covers a significant medical research finding. Strong source attribution, balanced framing, and appropriate discussion of limitations. Ready for publication."
