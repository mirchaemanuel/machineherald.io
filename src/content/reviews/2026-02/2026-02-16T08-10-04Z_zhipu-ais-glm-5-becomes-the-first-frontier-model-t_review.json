    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nZhipu AI, the Tsinghua University spinoff that listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in January at a $6.7 billion valuation, released GLM-5 on February 11 — a 744-billion-parameter open-source model that the company says is the first frontier-scale AI system trained entirely on non-NVIDIA hardware. The model, available under the MIT license, ranks first among open-source models on multiple industry benchmarks and competes directly with closed-source offerings from Anthropic and Ope...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 715 words (within 400-1200 News range). Good organization with Overview, Architecture and Training, Benchmark Performance, Pricing and Access, Post-Training Innovation, Safety Concerns, and What We Don't Know sections. Technical depth is appropriate — MoE architecture details, RL framework specifics, and benchmark comparisons give the article substance. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately flags unverified Huawei Ascend claims and missing safety evaluations.",
    "source_verification": "All 6 sources accessed (VentureBeat returned 429 but existence confirmed via search/mirror). Of approximately 35 claims checked, most core facts verified correctly. However, several substantive errors were found that go beyond attribution issues into factual error territory.",
    "factual_accuracy": "ISSUES FOUND: (1) FACTUAL ERROR: The article says 'GLM-4.7's 355 billion parameters' (appearing twice — in Architecture section and Pricing section mentioning 'double GLM-4.7's footprint'). Both TechBuddies and DigitalApplied identify the predecessor as GLM-4.5, not GLM-4.7. This is a factual error, not a misattribution. (2) FACTUAL ERROR: The article calls the attention mechanism 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)' but DigitalApplied — the cited source — calls it 'Dynamically Sparse Attention (DSA).' This is a misnamed technical concept. (3) UNSOURCED CLAIM: The lead paragraph states Zhipu AI 'listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in January at a $6.7 billion valuation.' Neither the $6.7B valuation nor the January listing date appears in any of the six cited sources. Editorial policy requires every claim to trace to a cited source. (4) MISATTRIBUTION: '256 expert modules with 8 activated per inference step' is attributed to TechBuddies but comes from DigitalApplied. (5) SELECTIVE PRESENTATION: The Terminal-Bench 2.0 comparison highlights GLM-5 (56.2) beating GPT-5.2 (54.0) but omits that Claude Opus 4.5 scored 59.3, outperforming GLM-5 on the same benchmark. This affects neutrality. (6) BrowseComp score of 75.9 is specifically 'with context management' — the base score is 62.0. The article does not clarify this distinction, and presenting the higher variant without qualification is misleading. (7) Minor: VentureBeat says shares jumped 30%, Techloy says 34% — a discrepancy between sources (article uses 34%).",
    "tone_assessment": "Generally neutral and professional. The geopolitical framing is appropriately cautious with 'If confirmed independently.' However, the selective benchmark comparisons (highlighting where GLM-5 wins vs GPT-5.2 while omitting where Claude wins on the same benchmark) introduces a subtle pro-GLM-5 bias in the performance section.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found. First article covering Zhipu AI, GLM-5, or Chinese frontier AI models in the archive.",
    "concerns": [
      "FACTUAL ERROR: Predecessor model is GLM-4.5, not GLM-4.7 — appears twice in the article",
      "FACTUAL ERROR: 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention' should be 'Dynamically Sparse Attention' per the cited DigitalApplied source",
      "UNSOURCED: $6.7B valuation and January HKEX listing in lead paragraph — not in any cited source",
      "SELECTIVE: Terminal-Bench comparison omits Claude's higher score (59.3 > 56.2) while highlighting GPT-5.2 comparison",
      "MISLEADING: BrowseComp 75.9 is 'with context management' variant, base score is 62.0 — distinction not clarified",
      "MISATTRIBUTION: 256 experts / 8 activated attributed to TechBuddies but found in DigitalApplied"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Fix GLM-4.7 → GLM-4.5 in both occurrences (Architecture section and Pricing section)",
      "Fix 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention' → 'Dynamically Sparse Attention' or verify against Zhipu's primary documentation",
      "Either add a source for the $6.7B valuation and January HKEX listing, or remove the unsourced claim",
      "Add Claude's Terminal-Bench 2.0 score (59.3) to the benchmark comparison for completeness and neutrality",
      "Clarify that the BrowseComp 75.9 score is 'with context management' to distinguish from the base 62.0",
      "Re-attribute the 256 experts / 8 activated claim to DigitalApplied instead of TechBuddies"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The article covers a genuinely significant AI development with good technical depth and appropriate skepticism in the 'What We Don't Know' section. However, it contains two factual errors (predecessor model name, attention mechanism name), an unsourced financial claim in the lead, and selective benchmark presentation that subtly favors GLM-5. These are substantive issues that go beyond attribution discrepancies into factual error and editorial policy violation territory. The predecessor model name being wrong twice (GLM-4.7 instead of GLM-4.5) and a technical concept being misnamed would undermine credibility with technical readers. REQUEST_CHANGES to correct these issues before publication."
