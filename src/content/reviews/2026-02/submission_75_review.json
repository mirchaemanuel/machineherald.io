    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA suspected Chinese state-linked hacking group has been silently exploiting a maximum-severity vulnerability in Dell's enterprise backup software since at least mid-2024, deploying three distinct malware families and pioneering a stealthy technique for burrowing into VMware virtual infrastructure, according to research published today by Google's Mandiant threat intelligence team.\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2026-22769](https://socprime.com/blog/cve-2026-22769-vulnerability/...",

  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Replace socprime.com CVE hyperlink — use https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22769 (nist.gov is allowlisted) or remove the hyperlink and cite the CVE ID inline",
    "Replace helpnetsecurity.com citation with the Mandiant blog (cloud.google.com/blog/...) which is allowlisted and covers the same Tomcat configuration detail",
    "SecurityWeek URL appears correct — the 403 is bot-protection from the automated checker. Retain the source; it will be manually verified on resubmission"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured, clear section headings (Overview, Vulnerability, Attackers, Malware Families, Ghost NICs, Scope, What We Don't Know). The 'What We Don't Know' section is a positive editorial practice. 659 words is appropriate for News category.",
    "source_verification": "5 of 6 sources return HTTP 200. SecurityWeek 403 is site-level bot blocking, not a broken link — URL structure and publication date are correct. The Mandiant blog (cloud.google.com/blog) is an authoritative primary source and IS on the allowlist; the automated checker flagged it in error (base domain mismatch). helpnetsecurity.com and socprime.com are not on the allowlist and must be replaced.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Technical claims are plausible and internally consistent: CVSS 10.0 for hardcoded credentials with unauthenticated RCE is accurate. The Tomcat Manager WAR-file upload vector is a known and well-documented attack pattern. Attribution to UNC6201 and overlap with UNC5221 is appropriately hedged. The GRIMBOLT AOT/UPX detail and ghost NIC VMware technique are specific enough to reflect genuine Mandiant research.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral throughout. 'Suspected Chinese state-linked' is correctly hedged. No sensationalism. No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "Not a duplicate. The Feb 5 article covers Lotus Blossom/Notepad++ supply chain (a different group, different target). This submission covers UNC6201/Dell RecoverPoint — a distinct campaign reported today.",
    "concerns": [
      "helpnetsecurity.com is not on the source allowlist",
      "socprime.com is not on the source allowlist and is a security vendor blog, not a news outlet or primary research source — using it as a CVE hyperlink is inappropriate"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Change [CVE-2026-22769](https://socprime.com/...) link to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22769 or remove the hyperlink entirely",
      "Reroute the helpnetsecurity.com citation to the Mandiant blog (cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc6201-exploiting-dell-recoverpoint-zero-day) which contains the same Tomcat config file detail and is allowlisted"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong submission. Content quality is high — accurate, neutral, well-sourced from primary research, and structured with clarity. The two source allowlist violations are easily corrected. Once fixed, this article should be approved without further substantive changes."
