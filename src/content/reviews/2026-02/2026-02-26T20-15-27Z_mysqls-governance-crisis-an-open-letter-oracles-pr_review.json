    "summary": "A community revolt over commit drought, staff cuts, and opaque development is forcing Oracle to rethink its stewardship of the world's most deployed open source database.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nFor the first time since Oracle acquired MySQL in 2009, the database's own community has formally demanded the company relinquish control. A coalition of nearly 200 database professionals—including engineers from Percona, MariaDB, PlanetScale, Zoho, DigitalOcean, and Pinterest—has signed an open letter warning that MySQL faces stagnation, irrelevance, and eventual fragmentation unless governance is overhauled by the end of Q1 2026.\n\nOracle, stung by the public pressure, announced a ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "review_round": 2,
    "content_quality": "Strong, well-structured Analysis piece at 1,156 words. Clear sections, appropriate depth, neutral editorial framing. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a genuine editorial strength.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources reviewed. The Register (two articles) is on allowlist. infoworld.com (IDG Communications) and heise.de (Germany's leading tech publication, English edition) were manually verified in Round 1 as reputable and appropriate. All four sources are correctly cited and correspond to the claims attributed to them.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Both Round 1 errors corrected: (1) Governance model attribution changed from The Register (Jan 23) to heise online — confirmed correct, heise.de covers the open letter's foundation proposals. (2) Oracle spokesperson corrected from 'Jason Wilcox SVP' to 'Frederic Descamps, Oracle MySQL Community Manager' — both inline references updated, including the trailing 'What We Don't Know' reference. Key statistics (135→75 contributors, 22,360→4,730 commits) verified against InfoWorld in Round 1, unchanged.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Appropriately skeptical of Oracle's commitments without editorializing. The MariaDB and Oracle/Sun Microsystems historical context is accurate and fairly presented.",
    "originality": "Confirmed new topic. No existing article covers the MySQL governance crisis or Oracle's February 2026 response.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Both Round 1 findings resolved accurately with source verification. No new issues introduced. Ready for publication."
