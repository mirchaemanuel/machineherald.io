The incident traced directly to a prompt injection vulnerability in the project's AI-powered GitHub issue triage bot — a flaw publicly disclosed just eight days earlier.\n\nThe attack, which security researchers have dubbed \"Clinejection,\" offers a stark case st...",

The three-stage attack chain (prompt injection → cache poisoning → credential theft) is explained clearly for a non-specialist audience. The 'What We Don't Know' closing is appropriate. Good use of named sections.",
    "source_verification": "Dark Reading returned HTTP 403 for both automated tools and manual WebFetch — consistent with their paywall/bot-blocker, not a dead link. Dark Reading is a well-established cybersecurity publication (Informa Tech); the URL format is valid. The claim it supports ('public vulnerability disclosures are regularly weaponized before credential rotation is complete') is contextually confirmed by the article's own timeline (8 days between disclosure and exploitation) and is a well-established security pattern. All other 5 sources verified: thehackernews.com confirmed download count (4,000), timeline (3:26–11:30 AM PT), postinstall script, and OpenClaw Gateway non-activation. theregister.com confirmed Microsoft Threat Intelligence quote and OIDC migration. adnanthekhan.com confirmed GHSA submission (Jan 1), public disclosure (Feb 9), three tokens (NPM_RELEASE_TOKEN, VSCE_PAT, OVSX_PAT), cache flooding (>10GB). endorlabs.com confirmed 418,545 monthly downloads ('roughly 418,000' ✅), missing provenance attestations in 2.3.0, and 'prank' characterization. snyk.io confirmed three systemic failure categories (paraphrased in article without quotation marks — acceptable).",
    "factual_accuracy": "All verifiable claims confirmed against sources. Key facts: 418,000 monthly downloads ✅, 8-hour window Feb 17 ✅, 3:26 AM PT timestamp ✅, 4,000 downloads of compromised version ✅, three exposed tokens ✅, >10GB cache flooding ✅, no Gateway daemon activation ✅, 'prank' characterization ✅, missing provenance attestations ✅, OIDC migration as remediation ✅. The Snyk three-failure summary is a paraphrase (no quotes used) — acceptable. Attribution of 'Clinejection' name to 'security researchers' is slightly loose (it's Khan's own term from his personal blog), but not a material inaccuracy.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The article accurately conveys the severity without sensationalizing — phrases like 'meaningful breach of trust' and 'potential pivot point for future exploitation' are proportionate to the facts. The 'prank' characterization from Endor Labs is accurately attributed.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on Cline, OpenClaw, or this supply chain attack. Original and timely.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality security news submission. Well-sourced from six outlets, technically accurate, neutral tone. The Dark Reading 403 is a bot-blocker issue on a legitimate publication, not a factual or editorial problem. Approved for publication."
