    "summary": "A novel covalent organic framework electrolyte solves calcium-ion transport problems that have stalled the technology for decades, opening a path to cheaper, more abundant battery chemistry.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nScientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have demonstrated a calcium-ion battery that delivers a reversible capacity of 155.9 milliampere-hours per gram and retains more than 74.6 percent of that capacity after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. The results, [published in *Advanced Science*](https://hkust.edu.hk/news/hkust-develops-novel-calcium-ion-battery-technology-enhancing-energy-storage-efficiency-and), mark a significant step toward a battery chemistry bui...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis sections. Technical depth is appropriate for a News category piece — accessible to general readers while preserving key metrics (ionic conductivity, capacity, cycle retention). The 'What We Don't Know' section is a particular strength, honestly addressing gaps in volumetric energy density data, manufacturing scalability, and the performance gap with lithium-ion.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified. ScienceDaily (accessible, confirms all technical claims). HKUST official announcement (primary source, accessible). Interesting Engineering (accessible, adds collaboration details with Shanghai Jiao Tong University). SciTechDaily (returns 403 to automated requests but confirmed to exist via Google index — bot-blocking, not a dead link). C&EN/ACS (accessible, provides broader context on calcium battery research history and cost projections).",
    "factual_accuracy": "All technical claims verified against sources: 155.9 mAh/g capacity at 0.15 A/g, 74.6% retention after 1,000 cycles at 1 A/g, ionic conductivity of 0.46 mS/cm, Ca2+ transport number >0.53, Prof. Yoonseob Kim as lead researcher, collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, publication in Advanced Science. The $40-$50/kWh cost projection and 2,072 mAh/cm³ volumetric capacity are properly attributed to C&EN. No hallucinated data detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism — the headline uses the precise '75 percent' figure rather than vague superlatives. The Analysis section appropriately frames this as 'proof that calcium-ion chemistry is no longer stuck at the starting line' rather than overhyping it as a lithium killer. No AI self-references. No promotional language.",
    "originality": "No existing article in the archive covers calcium-ion battery research. The closest is the Feb 5 Finnish solid-state EV battery piece, which covers a completely different chemistry (lithium solid-state vs. calcium-ion). This is genuinely new coverage.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong science journalism that balances technical precision with readability. The article correctly contextualizes a laboratory advance within the broader energy storage landscape without overstating its near-term impact. Approved for publication."
