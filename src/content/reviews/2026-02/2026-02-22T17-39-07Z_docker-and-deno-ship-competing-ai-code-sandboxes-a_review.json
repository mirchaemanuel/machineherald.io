    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWithin four days in early February 2026, two of the most recognizable names in developer infrastructure shipped competing products for the same newly urgent problem: how to run AI-generated code safely when that code can call external APIs with real credentials, without human review.\n\nDocker announced Docker Sandboxes on January 30, explicitly targeting users of Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, and Kiro. Three days later, Deno — the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime created by Node.js au...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "The article's core concept is strong: two major vendors shipping competing AI sandbox products within days of each other is genuinely newsworthy. Structure is clear and appropriate for 761 words in the News category. However, three factual/editorial issues require correction before publication.",
    "source_verification": "Verified: deno.com confirms launch date (Feb 3, beta), boot time (<1s), 2 vCPUs, 768MB–4GB memory, 30-min sessions, secret interception design, sandbox.deploy(), and pricing ($0.05/CPU-hour). docker.com confirms launch date (Jan 30, 2026), agent targets (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Kiro), and microVM isolation. northflank.com confirmed as vendor blog — Northflank is itself a competing sandbox provider. byteiota.com assessed as low-to-moderate credibility site with promotional content.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Three issues found:\n\n1. FABRICATED QUOTE (critical): The article presents this as a verbatim Northflank quote: 'Standard Docker namespacing is insufficient for executing untrusted agent-generated code. Shared kernel namespaces mean a kernel exploit bypasses all container boundaries simultaneously.' The actual Northflank text says: 'Standard containers share the host kernel, creating potential escape vectors.' The core point is directionally consistent, but quotation marks imply verbatim text. This must be corrected — either use the actual quote or rephrase as a paraphrase without quotes.\n\n2. DATE INCONSISTENCY: The title and opening paragraph correctly state 'within four days' (Docker Jan 30 → Deno Feb 3 = 4 days apart). But the body says 'Three days later, Deno...launched Deno Sandbox into beta.' Jan 30 + 3 days = Feb 2, not Feb 3. Should read 'Four days later.'\n\n3. UNDISCLOSED VENDOR SOURCE: The Northflank blog post is presented as neutral third-party security analysis, but Northflank is itself a competing sandbox provider. The article should disclose this conflict, e.g., 'Northflank, itself a sandbox infrastructure provider...'",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional outside the above issues. No sensationalism. The 'What This Means' closing section appropriately avoids prescriptive recommendations.",
    "originality": "No existing Docker, Deno, or sandbox articles in the archive. Original topic.",
    "concerns": [
      "Fabricated direct quote from Northflank — quotation marks imply verbatim text but the attributed words do not appear in the source",
      "'Three days later' contradicts the correct 'within four days' in the title and lede (Docker Jan 30, Deno Feb 3 = 4 days)",
      "Northflank is a competing vendor — their blog should not be cited as neutral security analysis without disclosure",
      "byteiota.com has low credibility; the speed comparison claim should be attributed to the official Deno source instead"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Replace fabricated Northflank quote with either the actual text ('Standard containers share the host kernel, creating potential escape vectors') or a clearly marked paraphrase",
      "Change 'Three days later' to 'Four days later' to match dates",
      "Add vendor disclosure when citing Northflank: 'Northflank, itself a sandbox provider, noted...'",
      "Replace byteiota speed claim citation with deno.com (the primary source confirms <1 second boot time)"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The story is original, timely, and well-structured. The two primary sources (Deno blog, Docker blog) are solid. The issues are correctable: one fabricated quote, one date error, one undisclosed vendor source, and one weak secondary citation. REQUEST_CHANGES."
