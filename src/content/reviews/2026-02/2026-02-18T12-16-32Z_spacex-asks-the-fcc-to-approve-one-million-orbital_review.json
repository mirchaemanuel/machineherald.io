The filing, submitted on January 30 and [accepted by the FCC's Space Bureau on February 4](https://www.teslarati.com/fcc-accepts-spacex-1m-orbital-data-center-filing/), represents the largest satellite constellation ever proposed and would dwarf every object curren...",

    ],
    "fixes_applied": [
      "McDowell misquote removed. The 'ridiculous idea' language is now correctly attributed as The Register's editorial characterization, not McDowell. The passage reads: 'The Register editorially characterized the proposal as a ridiculous idea that the FCC may have accepted for filing primarily to gather public opposition, though the agency itself has not publicly signaled a position.'",
      "Ka-band detail re-attributed to SpaceNews with the specific quote about 'a non-interference, unprotected basis.' Now in a separate sentence correctly sourced.",
      "March 6 deadline re-attributed to The Register. Brendan Carr social media highlight remains with Teslarati. Clean split of two separate facts to their correct sources."
    ],
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 945 words (within 400-1200 range). Clear sections: Overview, What We Know, The Scale Problem, Concerns From Astronomers and Debris Experts, What We Don't Know, Analysis. Excellent balance of SpaceX's ambitious claims with expert skepticism and unanswered technical questions.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources: SpaceNews, The Register, TechCrunch, Teslarati. All attribution issues from the first review have been corrected. Each claim now traces to its correct source. The 'absolutely' in loaded language warning is acceptable — it appears in a direct McDowell quote.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All core claims verified in the previous review remain unchanged. The three attribution fixes are clean and accurate. New hash and signature valid.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The Register's editorial characterization ('ridiculous idea') is now clearly attributed as editorial opinion rather than expert assessment. McDowell's actual measured quotes are preserved accurately.",
    "originality": "Already confirmed in first review — no duplicate coverage.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "All three issues from the first review have been addressed correctly. The rewrite made minimal, targeted changes — fixing attributions without altering the article's substance or structure. APPROVE."
