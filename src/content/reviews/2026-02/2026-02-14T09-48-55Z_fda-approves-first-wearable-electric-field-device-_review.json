    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on February 12 approved Optune Pax, a first-of-its-kind wearable device that uses alternating electric fields to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-device-treat-pancreatic-cancer). Developed by Novocure, the portable device is the first new treatment approved for locally advanced pancreatic cancer in nearly three decades, the company sai...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 690 words (within 400-1200 News range). Clear sections covering the FDA approval, mechanism of action, PANOVA-3 clinical trial results, safety profile, regulatory significance, and unknowns. Technical depth is appropriate — clinical statistics (CVSS scores, hazard ratios, survival endpoints) are presented accessibly without oversimplification. The 'What We Don't Know' section honestly addresses cost, adherence, and long-term efficacy unknowns.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as real, accessible, and correctly cited. FDA.gov press announcement confirmed: approval date (Feb 12), device name (Optune Pax), indication, mechanism (TTFields), Breakthrough Device designation (Dec 2024), PMA pathway, Michelle Tarver quote (exact match). CancerNetwork confirmed all PANOVA-3 trial statistics: 571 patients, 1:1 randomization, median OS 16.2 vs 14.2 months (HR 0.82, P=.039), 1-year survival 68.1% vs 60.2%, pain-free survival 15.2 vs 9.1 months, PFS 10.6 vs 9.3 months (P=.137), ORR 36.1% vs 30.0%, Grade 3+ AEs 88.7% vs 84.3%, neutropenia 47.8% vs 47.6%, anemia 21.9% vs 22.3%, skin reactions 76.3%, 8.4% discontinuation rate. Novocure confirmed 'first new treatment in nearly 30 years,' modified per-protocol OS 18.3 vs 15.1 months (p=0.023), and previous TTFields indications (glioblastoma, NSCLC, mesothelioma). BioSpace confirmed NCI statistics (67,440 cases, 51,980 deaths, 3.3%), device parameter preset restrictions, transducer replacement frequency, training requirements.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All clinical statistics match their cited sources precisely. Two minor observations: (1) The article uses 'pain-free survival' while sources use 'time to pain progression' — these describe the same endpoint but the article's phrasing is a slight simplification that remains accurate. (2) BioSpace appears to carry the FDA press release text nearly verbatim — some claims attributed to BioSpace (NCI statistics, device parameters) also appear in the FDA source. This creates source redundancy rather than true independence, though the article's attributions are technically correct. The 'nearly three decades' claim matches Novocure's 'nearly 30 years' phrasing.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Clinical trial results presented factually with appropriate statistical context (hazard ratios, p-values, confidence intervals). No sensationalism despite the breakthrough framing — the article notes the modest two-month survival benefit alongside the more dramatic pain-free survival improvement. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately tempers expectations by raising cost, adherence, and long-term efficacy questions.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found. No existing articles covering Novocure, Optune Pax, TTFields, pancreatic cancer treatment, or the PANOVA-3 trial. First medical device approval article in the archive. Fills a clear gap in health/biotech coverage.",
    "concerns": [
      "'Pain-free survival' is a slight simplification of 'time to pain progression' — both sources use the latter term",
      "BioSpace source carries the FDA press release nearly verbatim, reducing effective source independence (4 sources but closer to 3 truly independent perspectives)",
      "Article does not mention the 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer (13%, per Novocure) which would further contextualize the disease severity"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding cancernetwork.com to the source allowlist — it is a specialized oncology outlet that provides detailed clinical trial reporting",
      "Consider adding novocure.com to the source allowlist for this article — as the device manufacturer, it is the primary source for product announcements"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission covering a significant FDA medical device approval with rigorous sourcing. All clinical statistics verified against original sources with no discrepancies. The four-source base is adequate given that three are primary or near-primary sources (FDA, Novocure, and CancerNetwork's detailed trial analysis). Minor concerns about source redundancy (BioSpace/FDA overlap) and a slight terminology simplification do not affect the article's integrity. Approved for publication."
