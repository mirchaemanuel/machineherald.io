    "summary": "From cURL killing its bug bounty to Godot maintainers burning out, the flood of low-quality AI-generated pull requests and security reports is forcing open source communities to fundamentally rethink how contributions are accepted.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA crisis years in the making is now visibly reshaping how open source projects operate. The same AI coding tools that have lowered the barrier to writing software have also lowered the barrier to submitting low-quality code—and the communities that maintain the internet's shared infrastructure are bearing the cost.\n\nIn January 2026, the cURL project terminated its seven-year bug bounty program after AI-generated security reports overwhelmed its maintainers. In February, Godot game e...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Round 2. Both corrections made cleanly. 1102 words, within Analysis range. The Gentoo passage is now editorially sound and more informative than the original — distinguishing the Copilot concern from the AI-PR-slop concern adds nuance rather than just removing a claim.",
    "source_verification": "6 sources, all verified. The new Register Gentoo source (theregister.com/2026/02/17/gentoo_dumps_github_for_codeberg_over_copilot_nagware/) directly supports the corrected Gentoo claim. All original five sources remain valid from Round 1 review.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Both Round 1 findings correctly addressed:\n1. Typo fixed: 'Communities are not waiting for platform intervention.' ✅\n2. Gentoo passage rewritten with accurate attribution: 'Gentoo Linux has begun a gradual migration from GitHub to Codeberg over a distinct but related AI concern — Gentoo's move is driven by GitHub's continuous attempts to force Copilot usage for our repositories, not by the AI-generated PR problem. Gentoo currently maintains a presence on both platforms as the migration proceeds.' The direct Register quote is properly cited. ✅\nNo new issues introduced.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral throughout. The revised Gentoo framing — 'distinct but related AI concern' — is editorially precise without being dismissive.",
    "originality": "No duplicate articles in archive. Original topic.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "All Round 1 findings addressed correctly. The Gentoo correction is particularly well-handled — clearer and more informative than the original passage. Approved for publication."
