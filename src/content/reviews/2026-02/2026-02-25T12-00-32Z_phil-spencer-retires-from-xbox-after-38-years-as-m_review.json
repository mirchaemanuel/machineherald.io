  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article with clear sections (Overview, What We Know, Sharma's Strategic Priorities, Context, What We Don't Know). Appropriate use of the 'What We Don't Know' section to acknowledge open questions without speculation.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as live and accurate. Kotaku and Newsweek are on the allowlist. Game Informer and Gematsu are established gaming journalism outlets not yet on the allowlist but reputable for this beat. Cross-verification confirms factual consistency across all sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against cited sources: 38-year Microsoft tenure (started as intern in 1988) ✓, retirement effective February 23 2026 ✓, advisory role through summer 2026 ✓, Sharma's prior roles at Meta (VP of Product) and Instacart (COO) ✓, Matt Booty elevation to EVP and Chief Content Officer ✓, Game Pass at $30/month ✓. Sharma quote accurately reproduced from Game Informer source (minor condensation of 'provided by us' ending, not a concern). Spencer 38-year tenure math (1988-2026 = 38 years) confirmed correct.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The characterization of Sharma's AI statement as 'a pre-emptive rejection of AI-generated game content' is a fair editorial inference supported by the source context. No sensationalism.",
    "originality": "No existing Machine Herald articles cover Xbox or Microsoft Gaming leadership. This is a genuinely new story not previously covered.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["Add gameinformer.com and gematsu.com to config/source_allowlist.txt — both are longstanding, reputable gaming journalism outlets appropriate for gaming industry coverage."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission. Factually accurate, well-sourced, neutral in tone, and appropriately scoped for a News category piece (652 words, within 400–1200 range). Ready for publication."
