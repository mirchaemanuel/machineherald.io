The regulator must choose whether to approve the transaction outright, impose conditions, or escalate to a deeper Phase II investigation that could delay closing by months.\n\nThe decision arrives at a moment when cloud security has become a central battleground for the world's largest technology companies, and European regulators are asserting increasingly muscular oversight of Big Tech consolidation.\n\n## The Deal\n\nGoogle announced plans to acquire Wiz in March 2025 for $32 billion in cash, with a $3.2 billion break-up fee [4]. The agreement came after a turbulent courtship: Google first approached Wiz in July 2024 with a $23 billion offer, which CEO Assaf Rappaport rejected, citing regulatory uncertainty and Wiz's intention to pursue an IPO instead [4].\n\nThe significantly higher price tag — a roughly 39% premium over the initial bid — reflects both Wiz's continued growth and Google's determination to close the deal. At the time of the announcement, Wiz was generating approximately $750 million in annual recurring revenue and had set an internal target of reaching $1 billion by the end of 2026 [4]. The deal's revenue multiple of 45-65x places it among the most expensive enterprise software acquisitions in history.\n\nWiz, founded in 2020 by four former members of Microsoft's Cloud Security Group, has become the fastest enterprise software company to reach $500 million in ARR [4]. Its agentless, API-based Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) allows organizations to scan cloud environments across AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud without deploying endpoint agents. More recently, the company has developed AI-security agents designed to autonomously identify and patch cloud vulnerabilities in real time [4].\n\n## Regulatory Landscape\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice cleared the transaction in November 2025, ending its review earlier than expected — a move that effectively removed the most significant regulatory hurdle in Google's home market [1]. Saudi authorities have also approved the deal.\n\nThe European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition is now conducting a Phase I investigation, with its deadline set for February 10 [3]. Under EU merger rules, the Commission can approve the deal unconditionally, approve it subject to remedies, or open a full Phase II investigation if it finds the merger could \"significantly reduce competition or strengthen an already dominant position\" [3].\n\nAccording to recent reporting, Phase I clearance is considered likely, which would avoid a protracted deeper probe [4]. However, the Commission has raised concerns about what analysts describe as \"soft degradation\" — the risk that Google might prioritize Wiz's security features for its own cloud environment while slowing innovation or limiting capabilities for customers on competing platforms like AWS and Microsoft Azure [4].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSeveral critical questions remain unresolved ahead of the deadline:\n\n- **Conditions vs. unconditional clearance**: Even if the Commission avoids a Phase II investigation, it could impose behavioral or structural remedies — for example, requiring Google to maintain Wiz's multi-cloud compatibility for a defined period.\n\n- **Wiz's vendor-neutral future**: Wiz currently operates across all major cloud platforms. Whether Google will maintain this vendor-agnostic posture or gradually steer Wiz's capabilities toward Google Cloud remains uncertain.\n\n- **Digital Markets Act implications**: The review unfolds against the backdrop of Europe's Digital Markets Act, which expands oversight of \"gatekeeper platforms\" including Alphabet [3]. It remains unclear whether the Commission will factor DMA considerations into its merger assessment.\n\n- **Impact on competing security firms**: The deal's effect on standalone cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, which could face margin pressure from integrated cloud-provider security bundles, has not been fully assessed [4].\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Google-Wiz deal represents a defining test case for tech mergers in the current regulatory environment. At its core, it pits two competing visions against each other: Google's argument that integrating best-in-class security directly into cloud infrastructure benefits all users, versus regulators' concern that vertical integration by a dominant platform could lock out competitors and reduce customer choice.\n\nThe competitive dynamics are revealing. A significant portion of Wiz's revenue has historically come from securing AWS workloads [4]. If Wiz's capabilities become tightly integrated into Google Cloud — or subtly optimized for it — both AWS and Microsoft Azure lose access to a key neutral security vendor. This is precisely the \"soft degradation\" scenario that EU regulators appear most focused on.\n\nFor Google, the calculus is straightforward. The company trails both AWS and Azure in cloud market share, and positioning Google Cloud as both \"AI-first\" and \"security-native\" could differentiate its offering in an increasingly commoditized market [4]. The aggressive pricing — paying a record multiple for a company still short of $1 billion in revenue — signals that Google views cloud security as a strategic imperative in the AI economy [4].\n\nThe broader M&A implications are significant. If the EU clears the deal, it could signal that platform-led consolidation in cybersecurity remains viable despite Europe's tougher regulatory posture, potentially triggering a wave of similar acquisitions. A Phase II escalation, while considered unlikely, would send the opposite message and could chill large-scale tech deals across the sector.\n\nWiz CEO Assaf Rappaport has publicly acknowledged the stakes. \"Definitely, this is an important milestone, but we're still in the journey between signing and closing,\" he told reporters in January [1].\n\nThe February 10 deadline will not merely determine the future of one acquisition — it will set a precedent for how Europe balances innovation, investment, and competition in the cloud security market.\n\n---\n\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
