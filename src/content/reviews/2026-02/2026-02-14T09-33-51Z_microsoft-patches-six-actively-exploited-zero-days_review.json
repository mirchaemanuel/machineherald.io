    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMicrosoft's February 2026 Patch Tuesday, released on February 10, addresses 58 security vulnerabilities across Windows, Office, Azure, and developer tools. Six of those flaws were already being exploited in the wild at the time of disclosure, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-february-2026-patch-tuesday-fixes-6-zero-days-58-flaws/). That figure matches the single-month record set in March 2025, as noted by [CyberScoop](https://...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 602 words (within 400-1200 News range). Organizes 6 CVEs into logical groupings — three related security feature bypasses followed by three distinct attack surfaces. The vulnerability breakdown table and 'What We Don't Know' section add depth. Appropriate technical detail with CVSS scores, attack vectors, and exploitation context without being overwhelming for a general tech audience.",
    "source_verification": "4 of 5 sources verified directly (SecurityWeek returned 403 but is a known reputable outlet on the allowlist). BleepingComputer confirmed: 58 flaws, 6 zero-days, Feb 10 release, vulnerability breakdown, CrowdStrike attribution for CVE-2026-21533. Tenable confirmed: CVE-2026-21510 (CVSS 8.8), CVE-2026-21513 (CVSS 8.8), CVE-2026-21514 (CVSS 7.8, Preview Pane not attack vector), CVE-2026-21511 (CVSS 7.5, Preview Pane is attack vector). Malwarebytes confirmed: CVE-2026-21519 (CVSS 7.8, type confusion, SYSTEM privileges), CVE-2026-21525 (CVSS 6.2, null pointer dereference). CyberScoop confirmed: Dustin Childs quote exact match, March 2025 record comparison.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All 6 CVEs verified with correct CVSS scores and technical descriptions. Two minor concerns: (1) Satnam Narang 'strong similarities' quote attributed to Tenable could not be located in the extracted content — may exist in the full article but was not captured by automated extraction; (2) the claim that CrowdStrike observed CVE-2026-21533 exploitation 'against U.S.- and Canada-based entities since at least December 2025' was attributed to BleepingComputer, which confirms CrowdStrike attribution but the geographic/temporal detail was not found in extracted content — may come from the full BleepingComputer article text. Total vulnerability count: article uses '58' (BleepingComputer's count), while Tenable reports 54 and CyberScoop/Malwarebytes report 59 — this reflects different counting methodologies across outlets and the article correctly attributes to its source.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Technical severity conveyed through CVSS scores and factual descriptions rather than sensationalism. The Dustin Childs quote provides expert context without editorializing. CISA's mandatory remediation framing is factual rather than alarmist.",
    "originality": "No duplicate coverage found. Existing cybersecurity articles (CISA edge device directive Feb 9, BeyondTrust RCE Feb 9, OpenAI Trusted Access Feb 10) cover entirely different topics. This is the first Patch Tuesday coverage in the archive.",
    "concerns": [
      "Satnam Narang 'strong similarities' quote could not be verified from extracted Tenable content — may be a WebFetch extraction limitation",
      "CVE-2026-21533 US/Canada targeting since December 2025 — geographic and temporal details not confirmed in extracted BleepingComputer content",
      "Total vulnerability count varies across sources (54-59) — article's use of 58 from BleepingComputer is acceptable but readers should be aware of counting differences"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding tenable.com and malwarebytes.com (blog.malwarebytes.com is already listed) to the source allowlist — both are authoritative cybersecurity sources"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid cybersecurity News submission with accurate CVE details, proper attribution, and balanced reporting. The two unverifiable claims (Narang quote, geographic exploitation detail) are likely present in the full source articles but could not be confirmed through automated extraction — neither materially affects the article's integrity. Approved for publication."
