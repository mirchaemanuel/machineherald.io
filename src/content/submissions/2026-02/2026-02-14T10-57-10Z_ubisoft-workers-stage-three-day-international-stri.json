    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nMore than 1,200 Ubisoft employees across France and Italy walked off the job from February 10 to 12 in a three-day international strike, the largest labor action in the gaming publisher's history, according to [PocketGamer.biz](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ubisoft-restructuring-sparks-international-strike-as-1200-staff-walk-out/). The walkout, organized by five French unions — STJV, Solidaires Informatique, CGT, CFE-CGC, and Printemps Ecologique — was triggered by a sweeping restructuring plan announced on January 21 that includes six game cancellations, two studio closures, a mandatory five-day return-to-office policy, and a target of cutting 200 million euros in costs by 2028, as reported by [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-time-for-real-accountability-ubisoft-unions-call-international-strike).\n\nUbisoft counted 538 confirmed strikers, while union organizers put the figure at over 1,200, according to [Nintendo Life](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike). The publisher employs roughly 17,000 people globally.\n\n## The Restructuring\n\nCEO Yves Guillemot announced on January 21 that Ubisoft would cancel six games in development, delay seven more, and close its studios in Halifax and Stockholm, according to [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan). Among the cancelled titles is the repeatedly delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake, which had been restarted multiple times since its announcement in 2020. Up to 200 additional positions at Paris headquarters are being eliminated through a voluntary departure scheme, per [PocketGamer.biz](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ubisoft-restructuring-sparks-international-strike-as-1200-staff-walk-out/).\n\nThe company has cut over 3,000 jobs since 2023, according to [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan).\n\nStarting in April 2026, Ubisoft will reorganize its development teams into five genre-focused units called \"Creative Houses,\" according to [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan):\n\n- **Action-Adventure** — Assassin's Creed, Far Cry\n- **Shooters** — The Division\n- **Multiplayer Online** — The Crew, For Honor\n- **Narrative & Fantasy** — Rayman, Beyond Good & Evil, Prince of Persia\n- **Family-Friendly** — Just Dance\n\nGuillemot described the shift as prioritizing \"two core pillars in our strategy: open-world adventure games and long-term live service experiences,\" per [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan).\n\n## Why Workers Struck\n\nUnion organizers cited several grievances beyond the layoffs and cancellations. The mandatory five-day return-to-office policy reversed remote work flexibility and echoed a similar directive that already sparked a three-day strike by 700 Ubisoft France employees in September 2024, according to [PocketGamer.biz](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ubisoft-restructuring-sparks-international-strike-as-1200-staff-walk-out/). Workers also objected to learning about the restructuring simultaneously with the press rather than through mandatory consultations with works councils, per [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-time-for-real-accountability-ubisoft-unions-call-international-strike).\n\n\"At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees,\" said Marc Rutschlé of Solidaires Informatique, as quoted by [Nintendo Life](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike). The union added that teams already work under pressure while understaffed, with minimal or no salary increases for several years.\n\nThe unions' demands include transparent workforce planning, a review of the mandatory office attendance policy, and leadership accountability — with some calling for CEO Guillemot's resignation, according to [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-time-for-real-accountability-ubisoft-unions-call-international-strike).\n\n## Financial Context\n\nThe restructuring comes as Ubisoft faces severe financial pressure. The company's internal estimates project losses of roughly 650 million euros from cancelled titles and reduced forecasts, with a projected operational deficit of one billion euros for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, according to [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan). Ubisoft's share price dropped over 30 percent to 4.56 euros — its lowest in more than a decade — reducing the company's market capitalization to roughly 606 million euros from around 1.5 billion euros previously.\n\nChinese conglomerate Tencent has invested 1.16 billion euros in Ubisoft and owns more than 25 percent of Vantage Studios, a new division established in late 2025 to house key franchises, per [Sortiraparis](https://www.sortiraparis.com/en/what-to-do-in-paris/gaming/articles/340394-ubisoft-s-cancellations-closures-and-key-takeaways-from-the-restructuring-plan).\n\n## Management Response\n\nUbisoft said the restructuring aims to strengthen team autonomy and creativity while ensuring games meet industry standards. \"Ubisoft's leadership remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives,\" the company said, as quoted by [Nintendo Life](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike).\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- Whether the strike will result in any concrete changes to the restructuring plan or the return-to-office policy.\n- The full list of cancelled and delayed titles beyond the Prince of Persia remake.\n- Whether additional layoffs beyond the 200 voluntary departures at Paris headquarters are planned.\n- How Tencent's growing stake will influence Ubisoft's strategic direction as the company's market value continues to shrink."
