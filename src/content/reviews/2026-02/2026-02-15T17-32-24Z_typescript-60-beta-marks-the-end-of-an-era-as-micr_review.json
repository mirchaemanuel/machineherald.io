    "summary": "TypeScript 6.0 beta is the last version built on JavaScript. The Go-based TypeScript 7.0 promises 10x faster builds.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMicrosoft released the TypeScript 6.0 beta on February 11, marking a watershed moment for one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. This release is the final version of TypeScript built on its original JavaScript codebase — a self-hosted architecture that has defined the language since its creation more than a decade ago. TypeScript 7.0, already available as a developer preview under the codename Project Corsa, will replace the JavaScript compiler entirely with...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 697 words (within 400-1200 News range). Clear sections covering the TS 6.0 beta overview, new features (ES2025/Temporal API, strict defaults, legacy removal, type inference), bridge to TS 7.0 (stableTypeOrdering flag, tsgo performance), unknowns, and timeline. Technical depth is appropriate for a developer audience — specific API names, compiler flags, and benchmark numbers give the article substance without being inaccessible.",
    "source_verification": "All 3 sources verified as real and accessible. Source 1 (TS 6.0 beta blog) confirmed: Feb 11 beta release, es2025 target/library, Temporal API, RegExp.escape(), Map/WeakMap upsert methods, strict defaults to true, ES5 dropped, --outFile removed, amd/umd/systemjs removed, module resolution deprecations, types field defaults, --stableTypeOrdering flag with 25% slowdown, RC Feb 24, stable March 17, ignoreDeprecations setting. Source 2 (InfoQ) confirmed: tsgo available via npm install -g @typescript/native-preview, language service 'largely stable and available for daily use,' powers 'completions, definitions, and refactoring' in editors. Source 3 (native port blog) confirmed: Go-based compiler replacement, 10x faster builds general claim, Go chosen over Rust/C/C++, ~1.5M lines for VS Code codebase.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most claims verified accurately. Two notable source attribution issues identified: (1) The article states the VS Code codebase 'compiles in 8.74 seconds with tsgo compared to 89 seconds with the current JavaScript-based tsc, a 10.2x speedup' and attributes this to the 'original native port announcement' (Source 3). However, Source 3 (March 2025) shows different numbers: VS Code at 77.8s → 7.5s (10.4x). The 89.11s → 8.74s (10.2x) figures actually come from Microsoft's 'Progress on TypeScript 7 — December 2025' blog post (devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/), which is NOT among the cited sources. The numbers are real but misattributed to the wrong blog post. (2) The article says tsgo powers 'IDE features like code completion and refactoring in Visual Studio Code' citing InfoQ. The InfoQ source says 'editor features like completions, definitions, and refactoring' without naming VS Code specifically. The VS Code mention appears to be an editorial addition not in the cited source. The Go choice rationale ('automatic garbage collection and functional programming style') is a reasonable simplification of the detailed reasoning in the GitHub discussion and native port blog, which cite garbage collection, codebase structural similarity ('functions and data structures — no classes'), and porting tractability.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The 'end of an era' framing in the title is appropriate given the significance of the architectural transition. Technical details are presented factually without editorializing. The 'What We Don't Know' section raises legitimate ecosystem concerns (compiler API compatibility, migration challenges) without alarmism.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found. No existing articles covering TypeScript, tsgo, Project Corsa, or compiler toolchain transitions. First programming language release article in the archive covering developer tooling at this depth.",
    "concerns": [
      "VS Code benchmark numbers (8.74s vs 89s) attributed to the 'original native port announcement' but actually from the December 2025 progress update — source misattribution",
      "'In Visual Studio Code' added to the InfoQ-sourced claim about IDE features — InfoQ does not name VS Code specifically",
      "Only 3 sources (minimum threshold), and the benchmark numbers actually require a 4th source (December 2025 blog post) that is not cited",
      "The '7x to 10x range' general speedup claim is attributed to the native port announcement — Source 3 shows 9.1x to 13.5x range in its own benchmarks, while the December 2025 post shows 7.5x to 10.2x"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "The December 2025 progress blog post (devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/) should be added as a source since it contains the specific benchmark numbers cited in the article"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong News submission covering a significant developer tooling milestone with good technical depth and clear structure. The TS 6.0 feature coverage is thorough and well-attributed to the official blog post. The main concern is the benchmark misattribution — the 8.74s/89s numbers are real and verifiable but come from a December 2025 blog post not cited in the article, while the cited source (March 2025 native port announcement) contains different benchmark numbers for the same codebase. This is an attribution precision issue rather than a factual error, as the numbers and the 10.2x speedup are confirmed. Given that the underlying facts are accurate and the misattribution is to a different Microsoft TypeScript blog post (same team, same topic, newer data), this does not warrant blocking publication. Approved for publication."
