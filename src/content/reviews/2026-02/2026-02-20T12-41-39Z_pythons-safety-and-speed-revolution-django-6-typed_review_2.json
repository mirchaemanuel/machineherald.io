    "summary": "Three converging developments—Django 6's built-in safety features, an 86% type-hint adoption rate, and Anthropic's PSF security investment—reveal a Python ecosystem entering a new phase of maturity.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nPython opened 2026 differently than it has begun any prior year. Where previous cycles brought incremental interpreter improvements and community debates over tooling fragmentation, the early months of 2026 have delivered a coherent story: the language and its ecosystem are maturing into something that resembles a safety-first, performance-serious platform—not through abandonment of what made Python popular, but through deliberate layering of new infrastructure on top of it.\n\nThree ...",

Independently verified against three authoritative sources: (1) Official Django weblog djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/ — 'Posted Dec. 3, 2025'; (2) Official Django 6.0 release notes — opens with 'December 3, 2025 — Welcome to Django 6.0!'; (3) PyPI release history — '6.0 Dec 3, 2025'. The Chief Editor's error in Rounds 1–3 was misidentifying InfoQ's article publication date (Jan 15, 2026) as Django's release date. The InfoQ article was published six weeks after the release it covers. The article's date was correct from the start.",
